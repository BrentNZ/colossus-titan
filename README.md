# colossus-titan

Colossus is a Java implementation of the classic board game Titan. This
project is the continuation of the Colossus project, hosted for many years on
Sourceforge with Subversion.

I named this repository colossus-titan, to distinct it from those many
"Colossus" and "Titan" thingies that float around everywhere in the
internet. This combined name should be fairly unique and descriptive :-)

With this migration to GitHub, we also hope to bring the project forward to
semi-modern times, like svn to git, ant to maven, and perhaps finally give
releases a meaningful version number instead of the 0.x.y's which sound like
it would be in totally alpha state. Because in practice, the game has been in
active use, even with a public server where to meet other players.
