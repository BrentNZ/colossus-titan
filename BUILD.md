# Building Colossus

At the moment building is still done pretty much the same way as it was
during Sourceforge times - checkout and run ant:


```
git clone git@github.com:cleka/colossus-titan.git
cd colossus-titan/Colossus/
ant clean jar
./run
```

You need a JDK 1.7 or 1.8 and apache ant installed; I am using
ant version 1.9.4.
