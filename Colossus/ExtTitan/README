1) What are ExtTitan and Extended Titan ?

Extended Titan is an extension to regular Titan, the game
from Avalon Hill upon which Colossus is based.
ExtTitan is a variant pack to allow Colossus player
to play (a close approximation of) Extended Titan.
See <http://www.cheewai.com/titan/variants_extended.asp>,
as the original Two Bit Productions page seems
unreachable (<http://www.2bp.com/>).

ExtTitan was implemented by Romain Dolbeau <dolbeau@irisa.fr>

2) How to use it ?

Just use the "Load Variant" button in Colossus, and
open the ExtTitan.var file inside the ExtTitan directory.
That should be enough. If not, please report the problem.

3) What are the differences with regular Titan ?

New creatures, some old creatures are stronger,
new recruiting tables, and bigger masterboard.
See the page cited above for more details.

4) What are the differences between Extended Titan and ExtTitan ?

- only 6 players are allowed in ExtTitan, that will start
  in the inner 6 Towers. The two external towers can still
  be used for recruiting or teleporting or fighting or...

- Cannot recruit Wraith, or Elementals

5) Graphics are ugly or wrong !

The new graphics are only scaled-down version of the
graphics found on the aforementioned page. Old
graphics haven't been redone for upgraded creatures.
If you're an artist and are willing to redo the graphics,
you're very welcome !
