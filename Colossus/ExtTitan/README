README for Colossus ExtTitan Variant

1) What are ExtTitan and Extended Titan ?

Extended Titan is an extension to regular Titan, the game
from Avalon Hill upon which Colossus is based.
ExtTitan is a variant pack to allow Colossus player
to play (a close approximation of) Extended Titan.
See <http://www.cheewai.com/titan/variants_extended.asp>,
as the original Two Bit Productions page seems
unreachable (<http://www.2bp.com/>).

ExtTitan was implemented by Romain Dolbeau <dolbeau@irisa.fr>

2) How to use it ?

Just use the "Load Variant" button in Colossus, and
open the ExtTitan.var file inside the ExtTitan directory.
That should be enough. If not, please report the problem.

3) What are the differences with regular Titan ?

New creatures, some old creatures are stronger,
new recruiting tables, and bigger masterboard.
See the page cited above for more details.

4) What are the differences between Extended Titan and ExtTitan ?

- only 6 players are allowed in ExtTitan, that will start
  in any 6 of the 8 available towers (not only the inner 6).

5) Graphics are ugly or wrong !

Old answer:

#The new graphics are only scaled-down version of the
#graphics found on the aforementioned page. Old
#graphics haven't been redone for upgraded creatures.
#If you're an artist and are willing to redo the graphics,
#you're very welcome !

New answer:

No they aren't ! Jerry Reiger contributed new Chit for
the new and changed creatures. Thanks !

6) Why is the Griffon Rangestriking ?

Guy Dyson and James Gwinnett confirm that they gave griffons
rangestriking because wyverns gained slope nativity when they
became recruitable in hills, and they wanted to create a 
balancing advantage for griffons.  (There is no real advantage
to being native to woods.)

7) Fire Elemental is native to Slopes and Sand ?

Yes, it is. The originals authors and playtesters stated that
the Fire Elemental should be native to Slopes and Sand,
even if the available "ExtTitan.rul" says the contrary.
