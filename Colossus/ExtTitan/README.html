<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What are the differences with regular Titan ?</h3>

New creatures, some old creatures are stronger, new recruiting and acquiring 
tables, and bigger masterboard.  See the pages cited above for more details.

<h3>What are the differences between Extended Titan and ExtTitan ?</h3>

We do not yet support the Ent or Balrog optional rules.  Otherwise they should now be identical.  If not, please report the bug.

<h3>Graphics are ugly or wrong!</h3>

Not anymore.  Thanks to Jerry Reiger for the chits for the new and changed creatures, and to Josh Smith and John Lum for the Orange and Purple markers.

<h3>Why is the Griffon Rangestriking ?</h3>

Guy Dyson (author of Extended Titan) and James Gwinnett (playtester)
confirm that they gave griffons rangestriking because wyverns gained
slope nativity when they became recruitable in hills, and they wanted
to create a balancing advantage for griffons.  (There is no real
advantage to being native to woods.)
