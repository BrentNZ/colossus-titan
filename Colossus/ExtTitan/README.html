    <h1>README for Colossus ExtTitan Variant</h1>


<H2>What are ExtTitan and Extended Titan ?</h2>

Extended Titan is an extension to regular Titan, the game
from Avalon Hill upon which Colossus is based.
ExtTitan is a variant pack to allow Colossus player
to play Extended Titan.
See <a href="http://www.cheewai.com/titan/variants_extended.asp">http://www.cheewai.com/titan/variants_extended.asp</a>,
as the original Two Bit Productions page seems
unreachable (<a href="http://www.2bp.com/">http://www.2bp.com/</a>).
Archive may stille be available from <a href="http://www.archive.org/">http://www.archive.org/</a>, you can try <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001008194811/www.2bp.com/titan/extended.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20001008194811/www.2bp.com/titan/extended.html</a>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How to use it ?</h3>

Just use the "Load Variant" button in Colossus, and
open the ExtTitan.var file inside the ExtTitan directory.
That should be enough. If not, please report the problem.

<h3>What are the differences with regular Titan ?</h3>

New creatures, some old creatures are stronger,
new recruiting tables, and bigger masterboard.
See the page cited above for more details.

<h3>What are the differences between Extended Titan and ExtTitan ?</h3>

There shouldn't be any now, as we support 8 players, Elementals, ...
If you find any difference, please fill a bug report.

<h3>Graphics are ugly or wrong !</h3>

Old answer:

#The new graphics are only scaled-down version of the
#graphics found on the aforementioned page. Old
#graphics haven't been redone for upgraded creatures.
#If you're an artist and are willing to redo the graphics,
#you're very welcome !

New answer:

No they aren't ! Jerry Reiger contributed new Chits for
the new and changed creatures. Thanks !

<h3>Why is the Griffon Rangestriking ?</h3>

Guy Dyson (author of Extended Titan) and James Gwinnett (playtester)
confirm that they gave griffons rangestriking because wyverns gained 
slope nativity when they became recruitable in hills, and they wanted 
to create a balancing advantage for griffons.  (There is no real 
advantage to being native to woods.)
