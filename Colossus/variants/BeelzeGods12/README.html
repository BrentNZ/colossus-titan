<h1>BeelzeGods12 - Beelzebub12 with the Gods from Pantheon added, Version 1.02</h1>

<p>Idea by Matt Roe, implemented by Clemens Katzer</p>

<h2>Basically Beelzebub ...</h2>

<p>Most of it comes from Beelzebub, so you should familiar with that, or look it up there.</p>

<h2>... additionally, the following rules from Pantheon apply:</h2>

<p>Titan gains teleport at 1000 points (like in Pantheon); 
   Angel every 100 and Archangel every 500 is anyway same both in Beelzebub and Pantheon.
   (The additional acquirables from Beelzebub exist here too.)</p>

<p>The Titan-Druid-Knight-Priest-Estia line as in Pantheon does not exist.</p>

<p>As in Pantheon, the used-to-be summonables (Devil, Archdevil, Archmage, Fiend, 
   Phantom and Death) are not summonable.  Angels and Archangels <b>are</b> summonable.
   Since Beelzebub is unique (and hey, the variant is derived from Beelzebub ;-) ,
   so it should be something special, Beelzebub <b>is</b> summonable.

<p>Because there is no Mantio, those Pantheon gods are recruited in Hellmouth 
   (numbers and recruiters are now totally different than in Pantheon):</p>

<p> All gods have magic missile ability </p>
<ul>
<li>2 Knights recruit Aphrodite 4 5 flyer </li>
<li>3 Rangers recruit Apollo - 7 4 flyer </li>
<li>2 Wraiths recruit Hermes - 12 3 flyer</li>
<li>3 Basilisks recruit Dionysous - 10 3 flyer</li>
<li>2 Phoenixes recruit Dimitra - 8 4 </li>
<li>2 Fiends recruit Estia - 12 3 </li>
<li>3 Golems recruit Ares - 11 3</li>
<li>2 Hydrae recruit Poseidon - 14 3</li>
<li>2 Unicorns recruit Hepfaestus - 11 4</li>
<li>2 Manticores recruit Artemis - 15 3</li>
<li>3 Mummies or 3 Lichs recruit Athena - 10 4 </li>
<li>2 Mammoths recruit Hades - 13 4 </li>
<li>2 Colossi recruit Hera - 12 3 flyer</li>
<li>3 Lords or 4 DemiLords recruit Zeus - 13 4 </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Same as it is in Mantio, those Gods cannot recruit down</b> 
- e.g. Apollo cannot recruit Rangers,
and especially Estia cannot recruit down to Fiend, Devil or Imp.</p>
<p>
Due to technical reasons (because now whole Hellmouth is marked as
"cannot recruit down", also recruiting down from Beelzebub =&gt;
Fiend =&gt; Devil is not possible (for Imp this does not matter,
since one can get Imp in Hellmouth for anything).</p>
<p>
(BTW: Same applies to Tower in all variants: even if "3 of any non-Lord"
can recruit a Guardian, with Guardian you cannot recruit anything else than
another Guardian; apart from that you can get the Tower base creatures because
they can be recruited with reall "anything" - as long as the legion is not 
empty).</p>
<p>
Note: Fiend is now DemiLord instead of Lord as in Beelzebub.</p>
