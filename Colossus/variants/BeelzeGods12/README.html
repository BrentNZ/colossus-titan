
<h1>BeelzeGods12 - Beelzebub12 with the Gods from Pantheon added</h1>

<p>Idea by Matt Roe, implemented by Clemens Katzer</p>

<h2>Basically Beelzebub ...</h2>

<p>Most of it comes from Beelzebub, so you should familiar with that, or look it up there.</p>

<h2>... additionally, the following rules from Pantheon apply:</h2>

<p>Titan gains teleport at 1000 points (like in Pantheon); 
   Angel every 100 and Archangel every 500 is anyway same both in Beelzebub and Pantheon.</p>

<p>The Titan-Druid-Knight-Priest-Estia line as in Pantheon does not exist.</p>

<p>As in Pantheon, the used-to-be summonables (Angel, Archangel, 
   Devil, Archdevil, Archmage, Fiend, Phantom and Death) are not summonable.
   Since Beelzebub is unique (and hey, the variant is derived vom Beelzebub ;-) ,
   so it should be something special, Beelzebub <b>is</b> summonable.
   <br></br>
   Thus, only Beelzebub and the Pantheon-Gods (the 12 Olympian Gods, 
   plus the God of Underwold Hades and the reckless God Dionysous) can 
   be summoned into a battle.</p>

<p>Because there is no Mantio, those Pantheon gods are recruited in Hellmouth 
   (numbers and recruiters are partly different than in Pantheon):</p>

<ul>
<li>3 Rangers recruit Aphrodite 6 4 flyer </li>
<li>4 Rangers recruit Apolo - 7 4 rangestriker </li>
<li>3 Wraiths recruit Hermes - 9 3 flyer</li>
