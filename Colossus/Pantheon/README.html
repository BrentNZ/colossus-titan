<H1>README for Colossus Variant Pantheon (Version 1.0)</H1>
<H2>What is Pantheon Titan?</H2>
<P>Pantheon Titan is an extended version of basic Titan that attempts to add to the original Avalon Hill Titan. </P>
<H2>What has changed with the Titan?</H2>
<P>A Titan gains Titan-Teleport at 1000 points. He still recruits an Angel at 100 points, Archangel at 500 points, and gains a hit-point every 100 points.  Angels and Archangels CANNOT BE SUMMONED.</P>
<H2>What has changed on the Battlelands?</H2>
<P>The Battlelands for Brush, Jungle, Plains, Marsh, Hills, Woods, Desert, Swamp, Mountains, and Tundra have all been changed. They are all more severe, giving more advantage to native creatures. In addition, Hills, Bog, Bramble, and Drift have been added to new Battlelands in order to spice things up a bit. It is the same as in the Abyssal version except that Abyss is called Mantio (oracle).</P>
<H2>What are the new creatures and how are they recruited?</H2>
<P>The new brunch of creatures in Mantio are: </P>
<P>Titan recruit 1 Druid - magical rangestriker 3-4<BR>
1 Druid recruit 1 Knight - 7-3<BR>
1 Knight recruit 1 Priest - magical rangestriker 10-3<BR>
2 Priest recruit Estia (God same as Lord)</P>
<P>12 Olympian Gods exist in the game plus the God of Underwold Hades and the reckless God Dionysous.They are unique,battle-summonable lords,recruitable in Mantio under this conditions:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P>&nbsp;Important! 2 Cyclops recruit Behemoth in Jungle (a kind of compensation)</P>
<H2>What is the Mantio?</H2>
<P>The Abyss is the Anti-Tower. On the main board it is colored Pink. The battleboard is an upside-down Tower, with the "FREAR"(well) covered in drift. The defender starts in the walled-in drift. A powerful stack should be attacked when in the Mantio, whenever possible, as it is extremely vulnerable (SAME as ABYSS). </P>
<H2>What about the Masterboard?&nbsp;</H2>
<P>The Masterboard is almost identical to the original board, except all of the Jungle not in the "bus" has been removed.</P>
<H2>Who is responsible for Pantheon Titan?&nbsp;</H2>
<P>Sakis Spyropoulos is the creator inspired by the Greek Gods! It is obvious the game is a struggle to gain a God or more to help you fighting and winning battles in difficult terrains. For this reason the Angel and Archangel are not summonable in battle but only help you to gain the second in power God Hades. It is fun because a God is unique and helps only one player at a time?if you lose him ,he might help your opponent! (something quiet usual in ancient Greek Mythology).</P>
<P>Thanks to C.S.Raftopoulos this text has been written and a basic playtesting has been done.</P></BODY>
