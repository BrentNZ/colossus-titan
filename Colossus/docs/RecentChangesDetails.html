<h1>Recent changes</h1>

This describes the recent changes in some more detail than just the
one-line-info on the main pages "News" section.

<h3>September 16/17, 2008: Official Public Build from r3374</h3>
<p>
<i>(Content is mostly same as the "Public Testing Build" from Sep 16, r3369)</i>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: [ 2078529 ] "Preferences" => scales value is now read from cf file on startup.</li>
<li>Help=>About now tell also the actual .colossus dir and also the 
    log directory where Colossus[012].log files will be created.</li>
<li>When game is over, MasterBoard tells so also in Title and in "phase" label,
    and DONE button invokes then the Quit/Close/New/Cancel dialog (same as closing
    the window with the "x" in upper corner always does).</li>
<li>When gameOver state reached, skip summon/reinforce + kick next engagement
    (perhaps we undo this skipping of summon/reinforce soon again...).</li>
<li>Fixed (hopefully): [ 2074220 ] Exception while loading game with dead players.
    This includes a lot of small changes related to loading/replaying a saved game.
<li>Fixed: [ 2044310 ] LoadGame: wrong legions existing/content/location (same as 
    2074220).</li>
<li>"Server to Client" flow control => server sends only a certain amount of messages
    and waits then until client has catched up.</li>
<li>During loading of a game the Masterboard Bottombar (where normally the phase is 
    displayed) shows a "replay ongoing - turn x of n (please wait)" text.</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 2090866 ] AI spinners wrong intialized</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 2091811 ] Preferences window should restore if requested from menu</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 585329 ] Net game lockup from negotiation window;
    (made sure that Negotiation and ReplyToProposal dialogs are closed when same
    type of dialog is opened; and close them when battle starts).</li>
<li>Feature Request [ 2083312 ] game type - pantheon 12: created a new variant 
    "BeelzeGods12" - it's basically Beelzebub12 with the Gods and some rules from 
    Pantheon.</li>
<li>When creating new BattleMap, dispose previous one, 
    in case it is still open for some reason...</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 2060169 ] Skipping rangestrike, rangestriker(s) stay highlighted</li>
<li>During serverSocket creation, catch any exception, not just IOException.
    Also first display an error message dialog, before doing System.exit().</li>
<li>Fixed the problem that games with remote players could not be loaded</li>
<li>Reduced "window size" for server-client flow control; client displays 
    error message dialog if message counter mismatch encountered; when 
    starting new or loaded game, wait until all clients have catched up with 
    load/preparations, before doing setupPhase to start the actual game.</li>
<li>StatusScreen window now does not use scale any more (see [ 2078529 ] Preferences)</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 2073991 ] Game hangs on AI Split</li>
<li>Fixed (partially): [ 2074220 ] Exception while loading game with dead players:  
    Now it can be loaded without exceptions, but it wants initially as many clients as
    originally players were involved; especially troublesome if there were remote clients
    that are dead now...</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 22, 2008, built from r3332</h3>
<p>
A lot of things were changed this time. Some of them you as end-user might notice, some not...
<p>
<b><font color="red">Colossus requires now at least Java 1.5!</font></b>
<p>
<i>This time the changes in "oldest first" order
   (earlier they were mostly most recent first, or unordered...)</i>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Quite some internal cleanup, architectural changes (NIO, less threads, 
    started to share code between server and client instead of duplicate it, 
    rearranged java packages, game shutdown/cleanup more properly, memory freed, ...)</li>
<li>Changes which eliminate or at least provide more logging info related to 
    [ colossus-Bugs-1813362 ] "Battle hangs game, perhaps due to Java 1.5 ?" 
    {perhaps caused by GTK window Look &amp; Feel?}.</li>
<li>In Game setup a checkbox for "HotSeatMode". If mode is active,
    it restores on player change the <b>MasterBoard</b> of the active player and
    minimizes the others. <b>Does not cover the battle maps yet.</b>
    Also the satellites (game status, eventviewer, ...) come and go with 
    their respective MasterBoard.<br>
    So, something left to do here...</li>
<li>The items in the MasterBoard menu which are more like "Preferences" 
    (as opposed to: "actions") are now all moved into an own window 
    (Window=&gt;Preferences).<br>
    Documentation for Client is now accordingly split into two files 
    (actions in the menu, and meaning of the various Preferences items)</li>
<li>Includes now the <a href="WebClient.html">WebClient</a> (and 
    <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a>) functionality.<br>
    <b>We have the code working, but no server running :-( </b><br>
    <u>If you are willing to help organizing something into that direction, 
       don't hesitate to contact us!</u></li>
<li>Player name in the status screen stays in player's color. This allows
    telling who e.g. the green player was when green is dead.</li>
<li>Restricted logging to the Colossus classes.</li>
<li>Added "configure your favorite colors" functionality in Preferences.
<li>It's now possible to close the MasterBoard of a dead player (when several
    human players play on same computer). Earlier this would have quite the whole
    application. Also the dialogs related to Close and Quit are changed quite much.
<li>Closing the network client (or when it fails) you are back to the main
    GetPlayers dialog (instead of just whole application gone, as earlier).
    Web client dialog behaves the same.</li>
<li>Last Recently Used lists for server host and port work better now.</li>
<li>Network client has now a timeout and shows an error message when it fails, and
    dialog stays up, so one can try again.</li>
<li>Server port visible and modifyable in GetPlayers dialog.</li>
<li>New variant "Abyssal3" added.</li> 
<li>Various improvements to stresstest script.</li>
<li>A new (unfinished?) feature in the menu of the battle window: the new help
    menu contains an entry to show a summary of the terrains on the battle land.</li>
<li>A new dialog showing information about a player: a click on a
    player's name in the status screen shows a summary of a player including the
    legions and creatures currently owned.</li> 
<li>Improved log messages for earned points and half-points, and for acquiring, 
    and failures in acquiring.</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 1964752 ] Changing scale value sometimes causes exception.</li>
<li>Bugfix: the AI hints for the Undead variant were fixed so the AIs should go
    for a third Naga in Plains if a Griffin could be mustered on the next move.
    Also some other (minor) special creatures/lands typos in variant data fixed.</li>
<li>PickMarker and PickColor dialog layout changed to avoid wrap situations.</li>
<li>Angel Summoning changed: instead of the 2-step-procedure (select legion 
    on masterboard and then creature from legion in dialog) the dialog shows
    now all possible donors with the summonables red bordered. And the dialog
    contains some text instructing how to used it.</li>
<li>Negotiations (offer and accept) do work now.</li>
<li>Autosave filenames (and those created by just "File=&gt;Save" without specifying 
    own filename), are now long style; i.e. at the end they contain info about
    turn number, active player and phase.</li>
<li>In new SummonAngel dialog, Titan in possible donor legion is now shown in 
    player color with right power value (instead of the black default icon)</li>
<li>In negotiation dialog (make offer), clicking on marker toggles whole legion 
    (all chits) to dead or all to not dead again.</li>
<li>Save preferences back to clients cf file also then when preferences dialog is
    "close"d (not only when client/masterboard is closed). </li>
<li>Fixed: [ 2044243 ] "After summon and left offboard, can't after battle summon"</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 700478 ] "mandatory strike skipped":
    DoneWithBattleMoves now checks that it's indeed move phase.</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 1859016 ] "Done key and box disabled ?randomly?": 
    "Done" action (Button &amp; Menu) should now be correctly en/disabled during normal play, 
    also for the non-active players; 
    (but the situation after loading a game is not handled yet [1702874]).</li>    
<li>Fixed: [ 2028230 ] Terrain penalties not applied in combat (ogre out of brambles)</li>    
<li>Fixed: [ 2058959 ] Angel can fly over volcano</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 2046854 ] If Titan is killed in negotiation, game does not end</li>
<li>Partly done FR [ 491247 ] "Closing a question box":
    In PickStrikePenalty dialog, added "cancel", and cancel or closing window 
    do now cancel the strike, rather than striking with default.</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 1895129 ] "carryover gui issue"; this means also partly done 
    FR [ 558825 ] "Clickable spillover":
    For picking carry targets, now clicking a valid target does the carry there,
    clicking anywhere else does not harm (dialog and carry mode keep alive).</li>
<li>Fixed: [ 1608709 ] Problem mustering when choice (make it impossible to bypass 
    the Pick Recruiter dialog via Done key shortcut)</li>
<li>Made the PickRecruit and PickRecruiter dialogs somewhat more informative.</li>
</ul>

<hr></hr>

yeah, a long time no changes visible to the public (=no public build).
But as you see above, a lot of things happened...

<hr></hr>

<h3>December 28, 2007, build r2890</h3>

Just a rebuild of same codebase to get also a proper ZIP file.

<h3>December 24, 2007, build r2882</h3>
Changes so far (just most recent first, i.e. NOT sorted by importance... ;-)
<ul>
<li>We have now the <a href="http://colossus.wiki.sourceforge.net/">Wiki 
    pages</a> in use. Mostly for developers, but there there are also web 
    start file(s) for more experimental builds - i.e. already some while 
    before the public build is done.<BR>
    For details check out the 
      <a href="http://colossus.wiki.sourceforge.net/ExperimentalBuilds">
    ExperimentalBuilds</a> wiki page.
<li>Improvements to Battle Map:
<ul>
<li>Shows the die roll needed to hit.
<li>Shows adjustments (get more/less dice due to hazard or rangestrike)
<li>Legion markers show near the legions entry side
<li>Done button, turn+phase+activePlayer indicator
<li>An own page in the docs folder describes the features of the Battle Map:
    <a href="BattleFeatures.html">Description for the features of the BattleMap window</a>.
    You can also find this page from the documentation index ("The full docs are here.")
    on Colossus main page.
    
</ul>
<li>Changes in EventViewer which should eliminate some (harmless?) exception
    in AWT Event Queue.
<li>Vendor tag in Java Web Start file now "Colossus development team"
    instead of David Ripton.
<li>Action key and menu item for "Done" now in sync with "Done" button.
<li>Default setting for legion visibility now "Ever revealed ..." instead
    of "Only own".
<li>Legion info popups: holding shift key, ever each legion will appear a
    small legion flyout showing it's contents, and if known the legion value.
    Holding control key, they are shown only for own legions.
<li>Improvements to "View Battle Map": land name now top-right, so the normal
    "Land name corresponds to land number on MasterBoard" rule applies now.
    Additionally it shows the neighbor lands (both in the title, 
    and in the map are inactive buttons telling e.g. "Left: Woods 39").
<li>A LOT of internal cleanup and corrections.
<li>Slightly improved handling of Save Game if directory "saves/" does
    not exist yet or can't even be created.
<li>List of hosts in Network Client now not user dependent any more,
    eliminated one possible NullPointerException (game would hang), and in 
    the alphabetically sorted list the Most Recently Used one is preselected.
<li>Some cleanup and fixing for AutoInspector and EventViewer regarding
    initial size, position, and showing/disposing code cleanup;
    size+location were forgotten/reset to default if EventViewer 
    was left disabled for one full game; now fixed.
<li>Inspector and show-legion (right-click) window show legion value 
    (and owner, if not own legion) in title; concede and flee dialog also
    show legion values (=> feature requests [1818878] and [ 503862 ]).
<li>If duplicate player names, tell this as message box, instead of
    silently just doing *nothing*.
<li>Engagement window collects now all results, no matter whether it is
    enabled or not, and does not forget old results when closed; and if 
    at game start (saved via options) enabled, it *IS* vsible (even if
    empty). I.e. it behaves like all other satellite windows.
<li>Game Setup window is now a JFrame (instead of being a JDialog as it 
    was before) which means, it can be minimized, and has own taskbar icon.
<li>EngagementResult and EventViewer windows now handle time-losses
    properly (before, they just told "won in 8 turns" and "destroyed").
<li>Updated in documents that recommended Java version is now 1.4.2.
<li>After the fix for [1769985], when used Load Game button player 
    types and names were all wiped out. This is now corrected again.
<li>Most likely fixed now:  [1789116] and [1737239] ("Illegal move" message
    when going with a 4 up to tundra/mountain).
<li>Fixed: [ 1758248 ] Help - About is now also shown even if autoplay
    is on.
</ul>
<h3>September 6 2007, build r2711</h3>
Only minor changes:
<ul>
<li>Fixing: [ 1769985 ] "Auto quit when game over never changes"<BR>
In GetPlayer dialog options are also saved when using Load Game, 
not only when starting new game.
<li>The dialog box for "Illegal move" tells now a more concrete reason why
the server considers this move illegal. This is related to [1789116] and 
[1737239] (attempt to move from Plain 29 to Tundra 2000 and one gets
this message eventhough this move should be allowed).<BR>
Hopefully with this improved message this gives a clue what is wrong there.
</ul>
<h3>July 24 2007, build r2706</h3>
Most relevant changes:
<ul>
<li>MasterBoard menu items significantly rearranged:
  <ul>
  <li>Player menu now called Autoplay
  <li>Part of Graphics menu items moved into new "Window" menu 
  <li>Look & Feel under new Windows menu instead of being own menu
  </ul>
<li>"Show all recruit chits" replaced with 4-choice selection whether to show "None", "Strongest", "Recruit Hint", "All".
<li>Addtional event in EventViewer to show "Masterboard movement roll"
<li>Various bugfixes
<li>Documentation updated:
  <ul>
  <li>Added a doc describing all the <a href="ClientOptions.html">Client side options (in MasterBoard menu)</a>.
  <li>A document describing all the <a href="GetPlayersOptions.html">options/settings available during game startup (in Get Player selection dialog)</a> was already added few weeks ago.
  <li>Smaller other updates, corrections, NAME-tag adding in various other HTML-doc files.
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
