<h1>Recent changes</h1>

This describes the recent changes in some more detail than just the
one-line-info on the main pages "News" section.
<H3>xxx xx 2007, build r27xx</H3>
Changes so far:
<UL>
<LI>Engagement window collects now all results, no matter whether it is
    enabled or not, and does not forget old results when closed.
<LI>Game Setup window is now a JFrame  (instead of being a JDialog as it 
    was before) which means, it can be minimized, and has own taskbar icon.
<LI>In BattleMap now added: Done button, turn+phase+activePlayer indicator,
    and for the beginning player possible movement target hexes are 
    highlighted as if he would have clicked onto the topmost offboard 
    creature.
<LI>EngagementResult and EventViewer windows now handle time-losses
    properly (before, they just told "won in 8 turns" and "destroyed").
<LI>Updated in documents that recommended Java version is now 1.4.2.
<LI>After the fix for [1769985], when used Load Game button player 
    types and names were all wiped out. This is now corrected again.
<LI>Most likely fixed now:  [1789116] and [1737239] ("Illegal move" message
    when going with a 4 up to tundra/mountain).
<LI>Fixed: [ 1758248 ] Help - About is now also shown even if autoplay
    is on.
</UL>
<H3>September 6 2007, build r2711</H3>
Only minor changes:
<UL>
<LI>Fixing: [ 1769985 ] "Auto quit when game over never changes"<BR>
In GetPlayer dialog options are also saved when using Load Game, 
not only when starting new game.
<LI>The dialog box for "Illegal move" tells now a more concrete reason why
the server considers this move illegal. This is related to [1789116] and 
[1737239] (attempt to move from Plain 29 to Tundra 2000 and one gets
this message eventhough this move should be allowed).<BR>
Hopefully with this improved message this gives a clue what is wrong there.
</UL>
<H3>July 24 2007, build r2706</H3>
Most relevant changes:
<UL>
<LI>MasterBoard menu items significantly rearranged:
  <UL>
  <LI>Player menu now called Autoplay
  <LI>Part of Graphics menu items moved into new "Window" menu 
  <LI>Look & Feel under new Windows menu instead of being own menu
