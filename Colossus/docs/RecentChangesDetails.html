<h1>Recent changes</h1>

This describes the recent changes in some more detail than just the
one-line-info on the main pages "News" section.

<H3>September 6 2007, build r2711</H3>
Only minor changes:
<UL>
<LI>Fixing: [ 1769985 ] "Auto quit when game over never changes"<BR>
In GetPlayer dialog options are also saved when using Load Game, 
not only when starting new game.
<LI>The dialog box for "Illegal move" tells now a more concrete reason why
the server considers this move illegal. This is related to [1789116] and 
[1737239] (attempt to move from Plain 29 to Tundra 2000 and one gets
this message eventhough this move should be allowed).<BR>
Hopefully with this improved message this gives a clue what is wrong there.
