    <title>Colossus: Recent changes</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Recent changes</h1>

This describes the recent changes in some more detail than just the
one-line-info on the main pages "News" section.

<h3>Trunk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Player name in the status screen stays in player's color. This allows
    telling who e.g. the green player was when green is dead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 24, 2007, build r2882</h3>
Changes so far (just most recent first, i.e. NOT sorted by importance... ;-)
<ul>
<li>We have now the <a href="http://colossus.wiki.sourceforge.net/">Wiki 
    pages</a> in use. Mostly for developers, but there there are also web 
    start file(s) for more experimental builds - i.e. already some while 
    before the public build is done.<BR>
    For details check out the 
      <a href="http://colossus.wiki.sourceforge.net/ExperimentalBuilds">
    ExperimentalBuilds</a> wiki page.
<li>Improvements to Battle Map:
<ul>
<li>Shows the die roll needed to hit.
<li>Shows adjustments (get more/less dice due to hazard or rangestrike)
<li>Legion markers show near the legions entry side
<li>Done button, turn+phase+activePlayer indicator
<li>An own page in the docs folder describes the features of the Battle Map:
    <a href="BattleFeatures.html">Description for the features of the BattleMap window</a>.
    You can also find this page from the documentation index ("The full docs are here.")
    on Colossus main page.
     
</ul>
<li>Changes in EventViewer which should eliminate some (harmless?) exception
    in AWT Event Queue.
<li>Vendor tag in Java Web Start file now "Colossus development team"
    instead of David Ripton.
<li>Action key and menu item for "Done" now in sync with "Done" button.
<li>Default setting for legion visibility now "Ever revealed ..." instead
    of "Only own".
<li>Legion info popups: holding shift key, ever each legion will appear a
    small legion flyout showing it's contents, and if known the legion value.
    Holding control key, they are shown only for own legions.
<li>Improvements to "View Battle Map": land name now top-right, so the normal
    "Land name corresponds to land number on MasterBoard" rule applies now.
    Additionally it shows the neighbor lands (both in the title, 
    and in the map are inactive buttons telling e.g. "Left: Woods 39").
<li>A LOT of internal cleanup and corrections.
<li>Slightly improved handling of Save Game if directory "saves/" does
    not exist yet or can't even be created.
<li>List of hosts in Network Client now not user dependent any more,
    eliminated one possible NullPointerException (game would hang), and in 
    the alphabetically sorted list the Most Recently Used one is preselected.
<li>Some cleanup and fixing for AutoInspector and EventViewer regarding
    initial size, position, and showing/disposing code cleanup;
    size+location were forgotten/reset to default if EventViewer 
    was left disabled for one full game; now fixed.
<li>Inspector and show-legion (right-click) window show legion value 
    (and owner, if not own legion) in title; concede and flee dialog also
    show legion values (=> feature requests [1818878] and [ 503862 ]).
<li>If duplicate player names, tell this as message box, instead of
    silently just doing *nothing*.
<li>Engagement window collects now all results, no matter whether it is
    enabled or not, and does not forget old results when closed; and if 
    at game start (saved via options) enabled, it *IS* vsible (even if
    empty). I.e. it behaves like all other satellite windows.
<li>Game Setup window is now a JFrame (instead of being a JDialog as it 
    was before) which means, it can be minimized, and has own taskbar icon.
<li>EngagementResult and EventViewer windows now handle time-losses
    properly (before, they just told "won in 8 turns" and "destroyed").
<li>Updated in documents that recommended Java version is now 1.4.2.
<li>After the fix for [1769985], when used Load Game button player 
    types and names were all wiped out. This is now corrected again.
<li>Most likely fixed now:  [1789116] and [1737239] ("Illegal move" message
    when going with a 4 up to tundra/mountain).
<li>Fixed: [ 1758248 ] Help - About is now also shown even if autoplay
    is on.
</ul>
<h3>September 6 2007, build r2711</h3>
Only minor changes:
<ul>
<li>Fixing: [ 1769985 ] "Auto quit when game over never changes"<BR>
In GetPlayer dialog options are also saved when using Load Game, 
not only when starting new game.
<li>The dialog box for "Illegal move" tells now a more concrete reason why
the server considers this move illegal. This is related to [1789116] and 
[1737239] (attempt to move from Plain 29 to Tundra 2000 and one gets
this message eventhough this move should be allowed).<BR>
Hopefully with this improved message this gives a clue what is wrong there.
</ul>
<h3>July 24 2007, build r2706</h3>
Most relevant changes:
<ul>
<li>MasterBoard menu items significantly rearranged:
  <ul>
  <li>Player menu now called Autoplay
  <li>Part of Graphics menu items moved into new "Window" menu 
  <li>Look & Feel under new Windows menu instead of being own menu
  </ul>
<li>"Show all recruit chits" replaced with 4-choice selection whether to show "None", "Strongest", "Recruit Hint", "All".
<li>Addtional event in EventViewer to show "Masterboard movement roll"
<li>Various bugfixes
<li>Documentation updated:
  <ul>
  <li>Added a doc describing all the <a href="ClientOptions.html">Client side options (in MasterBoard menu)</a>.
  <li>A document describing all the <a href="GetPlayersOptions.html">options/settings available during game startup (in Get Player selection dialog)</a> was already added few weeks ago.
  <li>Smaller other updates, corrections, NAME-tag adding in various other HTML-doc files.
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
