### BattlelandsRandomizer ### README FILE ###

BattlelandsRandomizer is a (very crude) tool to randomly
create Battlelands for use with the "Colossus" Game.
It requires a JDK or JRE >= 1.2.1.

See <http://colossus.sourceforge.net/>

BattlelandsRandomizer use an input file that describe
the properties of the future Battleland, and generate
one random Battleland. At the moment, it's a purely
static, text-based process.

It's not finished yet, as no inter-hexagon hazard
are generated yet (such as slope, ...).

Properties are line of the form:

AREA <list_of_hex> TERRAINS <list_of_hazards>

where

* AREA and TERRAINS are the literal strings AREA and TERRAINS

* <list_of_hex> is a list of hex from the following available forms:
    (<number>,<number>)
    (<range>,<range>)
    (<number>,<range>)
    (<range>,<number>)
    <hex_label>
    (inside)
    (leftdefense)
    (upperdefense)
    (lowerdefense)
    where <number> is a number between 0 and 5, and <range> is of the form
        <number>-<number>
    i.e. a range of number between 0 and 5.
    <hex_label> is simply the label displayed on the Battlemap (F4, C3,...)
    The other four forms are literal
    string, and represent everything but the most outside Hex, and the 3
    lines of 3 hexagons representing the defense entry lines (left,
    upper-right, and lower-right respectively).

* <list_of_hazards> is a list of Hazard from the following available forms:
    <hazard_letter>
    <hazard_letter>,<probability>
    <hazard_letter>,<elevation>
    <hazard_letter>,<probability_elevation_0>,<probability_elevation_1>,<probability_elevation_2>
    <hazard_letter>,<probability>,<probability_elevation_0>,<probability_elevation_1>,<probability_elevation_2>
    where <hazard_letter> is a letter representing a Hazard ('r' for Brush, and so on, see BattleHex.java), <probability> is a float number representing the
    percentile of chance of the hazard being present (a numerical point
    _must_ be present for all probability), <elevation> is a hard-coded
    elevation (integer between 0 and 2), and the three
    <probability_elevation_X> are the odds of the terrain being at elevation
    0, 1 and 2 respectively (it's better is the sum is 100., but they will
    be normalized to percentile values).

BattlelandsRandomizer will then, for each AREA, try to put the
Hazard in any one of the Hex in the AREA. An Hex will not receive
two hazards, but if an Hex is present multiple times in the same
AREA, it may receive one Hazard per occurence of the Hex. In this
case, only the last Hazard is used.

AERAs are processed in order, so an Hex that appears in multiple
AREAS may also receive multiple Hazards. In this case alsom
only the last Hazard is used.
