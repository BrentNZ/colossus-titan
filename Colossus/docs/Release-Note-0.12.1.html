    <title>Colossus: Release Note for 0.12.1 plus two changes</title>
</head>


<h1>August 2, 2011: Public Test Build from r5033 on top of 0.12.1</h1>
<p/>
Some smaller fixes and addings. This build can be considered as "0.10.2 Release Candidate".
<ul>
<li>Fixed: 3384824 Java 7 update breaks the code.</li>
<li>Added some simple "Editing" functionality (by default not visible: 
    https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/colossus/wiki/CheatMode).</li>
<li>Fixed: Chat window did not always properly scroll to bottom when 
    several lines came from server within short time (e.g. /help output).</li>
<li>Some other small stuff became visible to users already earlier due to the fact 
    when versions were installed to Public Server (e.g. /help, /contact stuff).</li>          
</ul>

<p/>
<i>The following were already part of previous Public Test Build:</i>
<ul>
<li>On game client side, the reading from network and actual processing of the 
    received data is now two separate threads; this prevents problems that client 
    won't reply to server's "Hello, are you still alive?" requests in time.</li>
<li>On various places removed the "synchronized" access, which did lead at least
    for some players with Java 1.6 to deadlocks (GUI freezes). </li>
</ul>
<p />
