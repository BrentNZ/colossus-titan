    <title>Colossus: Release Note for 0.12.1 plus two changes</title>
</head>

<h1>April 19, 2011: Public Test Build from r5019 on top of 0.12.1</h1>
<p/>
Two changes which hopefully prevent "client stuck" / "client does not 
respond to server" cases somewhat.
<ul>
<li>On game client side, the reading from network and actual processing of the 
    received data is now two separate threads; this prevents problems that client 
    won't reply to server's "Hello, are you still alive?" requests in time.</li>
<li>On various places removed the "synchronized" access, which did lead at least
    for some players with Java 1.6 to deadlocks (GUI freezes). </li>
</ul>
<p />

<h1>Release Note for Colossus 0.12.1 (March 4, 2011)</h1>
<p/>
Two bugfixes and other minor improvements.
<p />
<ul>
<li>Fixed: 3184301 "Pick Entry Side" when not required.</li>
<li>Fixed: 3184700 Wrong phase when selecting creature to move.</li>
<li>Prevent on server side that user could propose several (instant)
    games in the delay time until reponse to first propose is back to him.</li>
<li>On BattleMap, Done menu item now disabled when it's not that players turn.</li>
<li>After undo move and rescale, clear mover legion and rehighlight 
    legions that can move.</li>
</ul>
