<h1>February 5, 2012: Release 0.13.0 from r5073</h1>
<p/>
Ability to reconnect after shortly interrupted network connections; two changes which hopefully prevent
 "client stuck" / "client does not respond to server" cases somewhat, 
plus some smaller fixes and addings.<br>
<ul>
<li>If client gets nak for done with strikes, after dialog highlight critters with targets.</li>
</ul>
<i>The following were already part of previous Public Test Build(s):</i>
<ul>
<li>If game client encounters connection closed (short network instabilities), it will try to 
    reconnect after a second, and will catch up/synchronize to get messages/events that happened 
    while being disconnected.<br>
    BUT, if client crashes/hangs, one can NOT restart a client from scratch and rejoin.</li>
<li>Fixed: 3473842 No Warlock on first turn option not sync'd from web server.</li>
<li>Fixed: 3384824 Java 7 update breaks the code.</li>
<li>Added some simple "Editing" functionality (by default not visible: 
    https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/colossus/wiki/CheatMode).</li>
<li>Fixed: Chat window did not always properly scroll to bottom when 
    several lines came from server within short time (e.g. /help output).</li>
<li>Some other small stuff became visible to users already earlier due to the fact 
    when versions were installed to Public Server (e.g. /help, /contact stuff).</li>          
<li>On game client side, the reading from network and actual processing of the 
    received data is now two separate threads; this prevents problems that client 
    won't reply to server's "Hello, are you still alive?" requests in time.</li>
<li>On various places removed the "synchronized" access, which did lead at least
    for some players with Java 1.6 to deadlocks (GUI freezes). </li>
</ul>
