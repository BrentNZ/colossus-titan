<h1>Public Game Server FAQ</h1>

Or: questions what someone was wondering and/or what I would like the users to know...

<h3>How are there 3 actual, when there are only 2 people online?</h3>

<i>Actual</i> is the number of people enrolled. <i>Online</i> says how many of them are 
currently also online.

<h4>Instant games vs. Scheduled games</h4>

For scheduled games one can logout and come back later, but stays enrolled (thus there can
be more enrolled than currently online).
<p />
One can be enrolled to as many scheduled games as one wants (it does not even check overlapping times yet)
<p />
In contrast, to instant games, when one logs out, is also unenrolled from the game (from 0.10.1 on the game 
is even canceled when the creator logs out). So for instant games, online will always be same as enrolled.
<p>
One can only be enrolled to one instant game at a time.
<p />

A game can be started when enough players have enrolled to it (actual &gt; min) and they all 
are online.

If not enough players ( actual >= min) enrolled AND online,  or the time scheduled time has not been
reached yet, the game can simply not even be started.

<h3>AI players</h3>

<i>"No npcs? I thought it would auto-fill them if not enough people joined..."</i>
<p>
Unfortunately not.
<p>
AI's (robot players) ( I guess that's what you mean with "npcs" (non
personal computer ... ?)  cannot be used yet.
<p>
The reason for that is the current implementation how games are actually 
started (in the Colossus application itself) - the would run on the server and eat the CPU there.
<p>
As workaround you can login and enroll with one of the ready dummies
dummy1, dummy2, dummy3 and dummy4 (password same as username)
And when the boards come up put them to autoplay (= same as SimpleAI),
and minimize their boards.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> You need to use <b>additionally started</b> Colossus instances for them - every 
started Java instance can only be one player. Logon as another logs off the previous one.
<p>
I have already a "start the game on some player's PC" mode implemented
but it's not fully ready to take it into use. In that mode one can add as many AIs as you wish.
The problem there is the "NAT" problem (behind a firewall/DSL box that hides
your real IP address); so this needs configuration on the player's PC/DSL box
to firewall and NAT to enable the other players to connect to him.
<p>
[ Future plans involve also a relay/proxy mode (runs on players PC, but the
public server acts as relay, and/or a "NAT punch" mode (it's possible to 
make the other players PCs communicate with the host behind a NAT, they
just can't initiate the contact by themselves. With the public server as
"mediator" it could be done). ]
<p>
One day I also plan to have a "add AIs to run on "my" PC" mode even if
game itself runs on the server.
<p>

<h3>I was looking at the timestamps here in the chat window - I was assuming that it was server time</h3>

No. They are your local time, "naturally". Also the game start schedules
etc. are shown by the GUI in your local time.
<p>
Local time of that server is German time :)

<h3>what happened then? I got logged out of chat, then the entire game XXXXXXed off...</h3>

That should not happen. However, as soon as the game reaches game over state
the server (game server process) closes the connection.
But the game client and the "web client" are *totally* distinct things,
closing the one should not affect the other one.
