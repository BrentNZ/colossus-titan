<h1>Colossus - Battle Map Features</h1>
<H3>Scope</h3>
This document describes a few of the current features on the battle maps
for Colossus.  Many of these resulted simply because Colossus is on a Computer.
<p>
There are a few options on the Main playing window (called the "MasterBoard")
that have direct effects on the battle map.

See: <A HREF="ClientPreferences.html">Client side preferences</A> page with attention to:
<UL>
<li><A HREF="ClientPreferences.html#AutoplayTab">Autoplay settings tab</A>
<li><A HREF="ClientPreferences.html#BattleTab">Battle settings tab</A>
</UL> 
<P>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The Battle map consists 5 main areas (From Top to Bottom):
<UL>
<li><A HREF="#TitleBar">Title</A>
<li><A HREF="#PhaseMenu">Phase Menu</A>
<li><A HREF="#InfoBar">Info Bar</A>
<li><A HREF="#BattleArea">Battle Area</A>
<li><A HREF="#DiceTray">Dice Tray</A>
</UL> <P>
The different areas are described in detail in the sections below.
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="#TitleBar">Title</A></H2>
The title shows 6 bits of Information:
<ol>
<li> Which player "owns" the Battle map. If more than one Human is playing 
hotseat style at this computer, this is one easy way to differentiate which 
board belongs to whom.
<li> The name of the Legion doing the attacking
<li> The CodeName for that Legion (used in saved game files and logs)
<li> The name of the Legion defending
<li> The CodeName for that Legion (used in saved game files and logs)
<li> The number of the hex on the MasterBoard.
</ol> 
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="#PhaseMenu">Phase Menu</A></H2>
If it is your turn you can:
<ul>
<li> Undo your last action this Phase
<li> Undo all actions you've taken this Phase
<li> Be "Done" with the current Phase and attempt to advance to the next Phase.
<li> Concede (Surrender) the current Battle and return to the main board.
</ul>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="#InfoBar">Info Bar</A></H2>
On the Left end is a "Done" button.  It is identical to the Done action 
on the Menu. 
<p>
On the Right end is the current Phase.  If it is not your turn/phase you'll see 
the name of the current player listed in parenthesis before the current Phase.
<P>
In Colossus there are 5 Phases to a Battle on each turn for each player:
<ul>
<li>Summon - Summon a summonable Lord or Angel via the Masterboard.
<li>Recruit (Reinforce) - In standard Titan and current variants the Defender 
is allowed to recruit a reinforcement before moving on turn 4.
<li>Move (Maneuver) - Move your creatures on the Battle map.
<li>Strike - the current Player can attack the enemy - Strike adjacent 
enemy creatures and execute rangestrikes.  
<li>StrikeBack - the non-current player can have creatures adjacent to the 
current players execute a counter attack or reposte. 
</ul>
<p>
In the middle is a chart showing the Current turn. On the current players 
battle map the current turn will have a Red border. On the other players screen
it will be grey.  Turn(s) where the Defender can recruit will have a "+" symbol. 
If the battle advances to the "Loss" turn, the attacker is automatically 
eliminated by "Time Loss".     
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="#BattleArea">Battle Area</A></H2>
In the Upper Right corner is listed the type of land.
<br>
In the center is the BattleLand.
<br>
Depending on from which side the attacker enters the land on the MasterBoard,
his creatures will enter the battle map on that corresponding long side, 
according to the rules. 
The marker for that legion (stack) will be displayed near that side.
At the opposite short side will be the marker for the defenders legion. His 
creatures will now enter the battle on this side of the board. (Exception: 
In some battlelands the defender will start in a special position. For 
example the defenders will instead start on the Tower in the Tower battleland.) 
The attacker will enter the side near his marker. The markers will be 
highlighted with a red border when there are creatures ready to be 
moved onto the battleland.  Damage taken by creatures will be displayed in 
red text. Dying creatures will be crossed by a red X.  When striking, the 
roll required to make a successful hit on an enemy creature is displayed 
by a small red die.  Adjustments to the number of dice rolled is shown by 
green text on a split red and blue die.
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="#DiceTray">Dice Tray</A></H2>
The last set of dice rolled along with the threshold for a successful hit are 
displayed in the tray at the bottom of the Map.  Successful hits are depicted
in red dice, misses are in blue.
<P>
This display area has now a scrollbar, so you can scroll back to review
earlier dice rolls.
