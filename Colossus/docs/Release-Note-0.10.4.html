<h1>Release Note for Colossus 0.10.4</h1>
<p/>
Some small new features, plus the usual usability & stability improvements 
<ul>
<li>Confirmation dialogs (optional) for omitted/forgotten split, 
    move or recruits (Thanks to David Partidge!).</li>
<li>New feature: "Need Lord for Battle Control" (Thanks to Bruce Sears!).</li>
<li>New feature: Possibility to mark legions as "skip" for split, move and
    muster (just made it "somehow", there's room for improvement in the 
    usability)...</li>
<li>Player colored angels and captured legion markers.</li>
<li>Closing BattleBoard does not kill that player (for not involved player 
    nothing happens at all, for involved player means conceding that battle).</li>
<li>Public Game Server rejects now Clients older than 0.10.3.</li>
<li>In Concede/Flee and Negotiation dialog, don't allow "x" dialog closing 
    - need to click on of the actions.</li>
<li>In WebServer games ( = when client was created by webclient),
    disable the Suspend button.</li>
<li>Numerous small changes to improve reliability / avoid server side 
    warnings/errors/log messages.</li>
<li>Changes to building, jarsigning, keystore, local JNLP files, etc.</li>
</ul>
