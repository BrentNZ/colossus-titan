Sometimes refuse remote newGame/loadGame/saveGame calls?

Set Client movementRoll when loading during movement phase after roll.
Set which legions have recruited when loading during recruit phase.

Add JUnit section to build docs.
Document test procedures.

Use SF project releases.

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F menu should indicate current L&F somehow, and not show Windows if not
   allowed on this platform.
If player chose L&F from config file, it should be added to menu.

Add Kunststoff L&F to jar file?

   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

Write more design docs.

   type, player scores for titan power.)

   legion markers.

   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

   than in separate windows.

Special-case less fear of initial 8-high enemy legions, to make AI move
   both legions out of tower in turn 1.

   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

   moves, not just destination hex.
