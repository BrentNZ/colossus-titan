Observer clients.

Sometimes refuse remote newGame/loadGame/saveGame calls?

   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
