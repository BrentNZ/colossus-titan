To the extent possible, objects further down the game logic hierarchy 
   should not carry references to objects higher up the hierarchy.
   Instead, they should carry String descriptors.  For example, 
   Battle and Player should not have direct references to Game, 
   Legion should not have a direct reference to Player, and Critter 
   and Battle should not have a direct reference to Legion.  This would 
   greatly simplify AICopy() since we'd only have to chase pointers 
   down the tree, not up it.  We'd have to pass more arguments, but it
   should be worth it.

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

AI: Consider recruit scarcity (last gargoyle more valuable than troll).  
   Don't leave non-moved legion highlighted. Don't cheat and peek at the 
   opposing stack unless all stacks are visible or some cheat option is set.
   Give some value to sitting in native terrain.  Get scrub snacks out of 
   nearby opponents' good recruiting terrain, and into blocking positions.

Scale Theodore S. Hetke's chits down to 60x60.  Fix text.  Add stars and
   bolts.

Movement die should be displayed immediately when enabled, rather than
   waiting until the next turn, unless no movement die has been rolled
   yet.  Same for battledice.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Add a way to show each player's remaining legion markers outside PickMarker.

Centralize scale handling.  Add a global rescale option.
Scale should change when windows are resized.

Should be able to undo moves until an engagement is resolved.
   If no engagements, should be able to undo recruits, then
   undo moves.  "Done with Engagements" shouldn't be necessary.
   Basically, phases should be less rigid.

Add an option to show information about MasterBoard hexes when a
   mover is selected, such as whether that legion can recruit
   there, and how many die rolls from that hex would let the
   legion recruit next turn.

Add allow the ability to replace any creature in a legion with a
   different creature type or "unknown," for PBEM and debug.

Change more modal dialogs to use a factory that returns a value,
   rather than a public constructor and a call to a mutator.
   This should reduce global access from dialogs to game objects,
   and allow dialog results to be more easily replicated by network
   and computer dialog replacements.  All parameters passed into
   the dialogs should eventually be read-only or clones, with all
   changes to game state done by the caller.

Add test main() to remaining dialogs.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)

Add ability to specify computer opponents in GetPlayers.  Also a
   way to pick which AI subclass each uses.

Add keyboard legion selection?
Add toolbars?
Add tooltips?

Highlight selected legion better.
Highlight teleport and normal moves differently.
Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there?

Color code StatusScreen better.

Add the ability to change the creature type of a creature in a legion,
   and to specify "unknown" as a creature type, for tracking PBEM
   games.

All GUI method calls need to be moved out of non-GUI classes.
Split GUI classes from model classes.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Add a ShowAllRecruits window that displays all recruits by terrain
   type.

Add SetupBattle class, to allow setting up standalone battles.

Fix concession timing.

Client-server networking.

Chat window.
