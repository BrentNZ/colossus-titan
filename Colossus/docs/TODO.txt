   CreatureCollectionView.
Add total value of all a player's creatures to StatusScreen.

   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

   stack visibility.)

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

   than in separate windows.
