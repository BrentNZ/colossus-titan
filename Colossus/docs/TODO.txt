Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there.

Color code StatusScreen better.

Have methods in Game and Battle return lists of hex labels, 
   rather than actually selecting and repainting hexes.  All
   GUI method calls need to be moved out of non-GUI classes.

Add some keyboard shortcuts.  (Need Swing?)

Highlight selected legion better. 

Split GUI classes from model classes.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Add a window that displays all terrain types and recruits.

Finish SetupBattle class, to allow setting up standalone battles.

Add server menu for save game, load game, new game, autosave, visible 
   stacks option, ability to create or dismiss status screen, 
   PickRecruits vs.  always reveal the biggest/smallest possible 
   recruiter.  Read option defaults from a config file.

Improve savegame file.  XML?  Need the ability to save at any time
   during a turn, not just at the end. 

Fix concession timing.

Client-server networking.

Add client config file to store default name, favorite colors, 
   favorite servers, etc.

Chat window.
