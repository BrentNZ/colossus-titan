Advance phases on space instead of 'D'?

Need a prettier question.gif

Confirmation prompt to avoid skipping recruits?

AI needs to stop moving when the game ends.

Make AI advance phase delay configurable.

Attacking AI creatures need to chargest closest enemy in the last few
   turns, rather than accepting a time loss.

Allow first human player to control game options, load game, etc.

Split GUI classes from model classes.

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Get minimax masterboard moves working.

Make advance phase delay configurable.
Add AI time limits.
Add AI progress indicator, hourglass cursor.

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

AI: Consider recruit scarcity (last gargoyle possibly more valuable than 
   troll).  Don't cheat and peek at opposing stacks unless all stacks 
   are visible or some cheat option is set.  Give some value to sitting in 
   native terrain.  Get scrub snacks out of nearby opponents' good 
   recruiting terrain and into blocking positions.

Write some design docs.

Movement die should be displayed immediately when enabled, rather than
   waiting until the next turn, unless no movement die has been rolled
   yet.  Same for battle dice, which means always keeping the information
   up to date even if it's not being used.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.
Add a ShowAllRecruits window that displays all recruits by terrain type.
Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add an option to show information about MasterBoard hexes when a
   mover is selected, such as whether that legion can recruit
   there, and how many die rolls from that hex would let the
   legion recruit next turn.

Add the ability to replace any creature in a legion with a different 
   creature type or "unknown," for PBEM and debug.

Change more modal dialogs to use a factory that returns a value,
   rather than a public constructor and a call to a mutator.
   This should reduce global access from dialogs to game objects,
   and allow dialog results to be more easily replicated by network
   and computer dialog replacements.  
All parameters passed into dialogs should be read-only or clones, with 
   all changes to game state done by the caller.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Add keyboard legion/critter selection?  (Previous, next, unselect keys)
Add toolbars?
Add tooltips?

Highlight selected legion better.
Highlight teleport and normal moves differently, and show entry sides.
Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there?

Color code StatusScreen better.

Show StatusScreen / MovementDie / ShowLegion info in the masterboard
   window, rather than in separate windows.  Show BattleDice info in
   the BattleMap window, rather than a separate window.

Add the ability to change the creature type of a creature in a legion,
   and to specify "unknown" as a creature type, for tracking PBEM games.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Fix concession timing.

Client-server networking.

Chat window.  (From Prometheus.)
