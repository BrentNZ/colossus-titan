Write a minimal, complete Game.loadGame() that reuses existing 
   objects as much as possible.

Disable file-related options when running as an applet.

Add per-player option menu, with results saved to playername.cfg

Add chits and hexes to containers and use layout managers to place
   chits?  Difficulties with overlapping hexes, stacked chits.

Change more modal dialogs to use a factory that returns a value,
   rather than a public constructor and a call to a mutator.
   This should reduce global access from dialogs to game objects, 
   and allow dialog results to be more easily replicated by network 
   and computer dialog replacements.  All parameters passed into 
   the dialogs should eventually be read-only or clones, with all
   changes to game state done by the caller.

Add test main() to remaining dialogs.

Skip strikes that can't matter.

Add keyboard legion selection?
Add toolbars?
Add tooltips?

Should be able to undo moves until an engagement is resolved.
   If no engagements, should be able to undo recruits, then
   undo moves.  "Done with Engagements" shouldn't be necessary.

Highlight selected legion better. 
Highlight teleport and normal moves differently.
Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there?

Color code StatusScreen better.

All GUI method calls need to be moved out of non-GUI classes.
Split GUI classes from model classes.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Add a ShowAllRecruits window that displays all recruits by terrain 
   type.

Add SetupBattle class, to allow setting up standalone battles.
