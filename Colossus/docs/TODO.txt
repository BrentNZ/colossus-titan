Bug: SplitLegion still resizes slightly in Solaris/CDE/1.4.0

Bug: Winning legion's marker not aligned after winning engagement (by
   battle or flee).


Put old, new web pages under CVS.
Switch to new web page.

Do some sorting of chits within legions on client side.

Document Javadepend in build.tex

Fix pic used for minimized icon.
Include an .ico file for Windows.  (ImageMagick can autogenerate one.)
Maybe have a separate icons directory rather than reusing the ones
   in Default/images?

Add command-line options to start a game with N AIs, have the game exit
   java when done, etc. to support automated testing.  GetOpt package?
Options to auto quit JVM when game over, auto stop when last human dies.

Document test procedures.
Add some JUnit tests.

ShowLegion on mouseover, not click, with permanent dialog.

Highlight appropriate engagement hex while engagement is being resolved.
   (Except during angel summoning.)

Initialize autoPickRecruiter and Show Graphical Overlays to true by default.

Optional post-engagement status dialog.

Change some dialogs to show info in a label instead of the title (so
   the dialog is wide enough) and add explicit cancel buttons.

Remove remaining public Client methods that only directly control the GUI
   in favor of higher-level events.

Always show the current turn, player, and phase in a panel somewhere.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, skipping recruits, ...)

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Add display of dead creatures / total creatures / creatures in play to
   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

Reveal all stacks at game end.

Allow players to specify that they automatically refuse to negotiate.  
   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

Prompt player whether to continue game after last human player dies
   if AIs remain.

Remember window positions in .cfg file.
Remember GetPlayers settings in .cfg file.

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

When a stack flees, make the winning stack visible, to the fleeing
   legion's player's client only.  (Per-player rather than global
   stack visibility.)

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Write more design docs.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.
Add balanced tower setup option.

Show StatusScreen and ShowLegion info in the masterboard window, rather 
   than in separate windows.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.

Special-case less fear of initial 8-high enemy legions, to make AI move
   both legions out of tower in turn 1.
