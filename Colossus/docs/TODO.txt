(Legion is actually 6 high -- one of those rangers isn't really there.  Missed a RemoveCreature?)

Bug: ShowLegion appears in wrong place when MasterBoard is scrolled.

Bug: AI player sometimes leaves reinforcements offboard unnecessarily.

Bug: The duplicate name detection code for network players is now
   failing with the new initialization timing -- oscillating fixNames
   between dripton and dripton4

Bug: 2-high titan stack did not run away even though it could be caught
   on 4-6 by a 6-high stack:
Gold rolls a 4 for movement
considering risk of leaving Gd01 in Brush hex 109
got enemies that can attack on a 1 :[Rd04]
got enemies that can attack on a 2 :[Rd04, Rd11]
got enemies that can attack on a 3 :[Rd04, Rd11]
got enemies that can attack on a 4 :[Rd02, Rd04, Rd11]
got enemies that can attack on a 5 :[Rd01, Rd02, Rd04, Rd11]
got enemies that can attack on a 6 :[Rd01, Rd02, Rd04, Rd11]
EVAL Gd01 stay in Brush hex 109 = 0
considering risk of moving Gd01 to Plains hex 105
got enemies that can attack on a 5 :[Bu03]
got enemies that can attack on a 6 :[Bu03]
EVAL Gd01 move to Plains hex 105 = 0

Bug: Titan teleport onto chaff stack in tower, 1 warlock left, recruitChit
   shows ogre instead of warlock.

Bug: Loaded a game with 2 human players and 4 AIs.  Only got one board.

Bug: Enemy had two stacks, one fully known and one fully unknown.  Should
   have been fully known by process of elimination.

Bug: Out of memory error after many consecutive Load Game actions.  Find leak.

EASY Compute numLegions, numMarkers, numCreatures, titan power, total point value
   on client side rather than passing them in player info.

EASY Indicate which players have titan teleport in StatusScreen.

EASY Disable "AIs stop when humans dead" if no human players at start of game.

EASY Make inverting defending units optional.

Synchronize repaints in StatusScreen so yellow moves all at once

Finish EngagementResults:
   Non-overlapping dialogs?  Make it a tabbled dialog?
   Add game turn number.
   Options (Show at all?  Show for own battles?)
   Show legion contents before and after battle

Animated timer showing time left for AI in battles.

Have server send marker names.

Toolbar, or at least Done button.

Change some JDialogs to JFrames to allow separate minimizing?
Should be able to move recruit chart behind board, map.
OR
Make BattleMap a JDialog rather than a JFrame (moving menu), to fix focus.

Add link from client to LogWindow; advance scroll thumb at end of various
   phases.

Should be able to clear recruitChits in any phase.  Move to Graphics menu?
Allow displaying stuff during other players' turns.
Ability to dismiss and recall recruitChits

Real whole-legion battle eval function, including gang hits.

Refactor to eliminate duplicate code.  (Especially Movement, BattleMovement, 
   Strike, Creature/Critter/CreatureInfo)
Fix the Titan Creature/Critter problem.

Machine learning to tweak AI constants.

Improve networking.  
   Persistent servers, 
   Reporting game openings to web page.

When getting both a PickRecruit and an AcquireAngel after a battle,
   make sure the PickRecruit is on top, because it's modal.
   Or make PickRecruit non-modal.

Observer clients.

Sometimes refuse remote newGame/loadGame/saveGame calls?

Cleanup network shutdown -- when game over or player eliminated, don't
   whine if its client drops.

Fully event-driven savegames.
Use identical events for network protocol.
Use events to support infinite undo/redo, VCR controls to step through
   games, stepping AI, etc.

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F should not show Windows if not allowed on this platform.
Eliminate L&F menu entirely?

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Put old, new web pages under CVS.
Use SF project releases.

ShowLegion on mouseover, not click, with permanent dialog.
Show zoomed area around mouse cursor in a small window, for Abyssal9.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, skipping recruits, ...)

Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.
Turn map to move player's entrance (or attacker's if observing) to 
   bottom.  Line up entering creatures rather than overlapping.
   Color-code entrances.
Make BattleMap less tall.  Move dice, etc. to one side.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Track all players' markers on client side.
Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining
   markers.

Add a window that shows all players' units

Add a window that shows all game options.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.

After JDK 1.4.1 for MacOS is released:
   Update JNLP file to force 1.4+
   JSpinner
   Boxes, not JPanels with BoxLayouts
   SO_REUSEADDR on server socket
   Remove duplicated XML library code.

Make split prediction optional.

SVG chits.  Maybe SVG board and map, after we have SVG chits.  (No point
   before then -- just drags in Batik without giving infinite rescaling.)

Place SummonAngel so that it doesn't overlap any of the player's markers
   with summonable angels.
