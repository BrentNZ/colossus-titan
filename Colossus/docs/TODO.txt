Scale Theodore S. Hetke's chits down to 60x60.  Fix text.  Add stars and
   bolts.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Centralize scale handling.  Add a global rescale option.

Allow an arbitrary number of undo operations, rather than just one.
   Allow redo?

Add an option to show information about MasterBoard hexes when a
   mover is selected, such as whether that legion can recruit
   there, and how many die rolls from that hex would let the
   legion recruit next turn.

Add allow the ability to replace any creature in a legion with a
   different creature type or "unknown," for PBEM and debug.

Add per-player option menu, with results saved to playername.cfg

Change more modal dialogs to use a factory that returns a value,
   rather than a public constructor and a call to a mutator.
   This should reduce global access from dialogs to game objects,
   and allow dialog results to be more easily replicated by network
   and computer dialog replacements.  All parameters passed into
   the dialogs should eventually be read-only or clones, with all
   changes to game state done by the caller.

Add test main() to remaining dialogs.

Test optimizations (strength reduction of divides, and substitution
   of method calls for mod 6) to see if they actually make a
   measurable difference.  Get rid of them if they don't.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add auto-forced-strike option.
Add auto-pick-entry-side option.
Add auto-MasterBoard-move option.
Add auto-BattleMap-move option.
Add auto-strike option.
Add auto-split option.
Add auto-flee option.
Add auto-play option.  (aka Really Dumb Computer Opponent.)

Add ability to specify computer opponents in GetPlayers.

Skip strikes that can't matter.

Add keyboard legion selection?
Add toolbars?
Add tooltips?

Should be able to undo moves until an engagement is resolved.
   If no engagements, should be able to undo recruits, then
   undo moves.  "Done with Engagements" shouldn't be necessary.

Highlight selected legion better.
Highlight teleport and normal moves differently.
Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there?

Color code StatusScreen better.
Add the ability to choose towers, movement die rolls, and number of
   hits in combat, rather than rolling, for debug and tracking
   PBEM games.

Add the ability to change the creature type of a creature in a legion,
   and to specify "unknown" as a creature type, for tracking PBEM
   games.

All GUI method calls need to be moved out of non-GUI classes.
Split GUI classes from model classes.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Add a ShowAllRecruits window that displays all recruits by terrain
   type.

Allow setting Look and Feel from a menu.

Add SetupBattle class, to allow setting up standalone battles.

Fix concession timing.

Client-server networking.

Add client config file to store default name, favorite colors,
   favorite servers, etc.

Chat window.
