Bug: Zero-high stack hangs around forever after summoning angel from it.

Implement auto stop when all human players dead.

Add some full board repaints, including frame, to fix menu corruption.

Add unit tests for server options.
Add JUnit section to build docs.
Document test procedures.

Add remaining command-line options.

Save/load/test scale.

Use SF project releases.

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F menu should indicate current L&F somehow, and not show Windows if not
   allowed on this platform.  
kunstoff L&F in swing.properties file fails.  Works in player cfg file.

Add explicit cancel buttons to more dialogs.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Add UI for setting server options before starting game.
Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Remember window positions in player .cfg file.

Send creature list, summonable list, recruit tree, etc. to clients at startup.

Put old, new web pages under CVS.
Switch to new web page.

Include a Colossus.ico file for Windows.

ShowLegion on mouseover, not click, with permanent dialog.

Highlight appropriate engagement hex while engagement is being resolved.
   (Except during angel summoning.)

Initialize autoPickRecruiter and Show Graphical Overlays to true by default.

Optional post-engagement status dialog.

Remove remaining public Client methods that only directly control the GUI
   in favor of higher-level events.

Always show the current turn, player, and phase in a panel somewhere.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, skipping recruits, ...)

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Add display of dead creatures / total creatures / creatures in play to
   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

Reveal all stacks at game end.

Write more design docs.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Finish networked negotiation. 
Allow players to specify that they automatically refuse to negotiate.  
   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

Show StatusScreen and ShowLegion info in the masterboard window, rather 
   than in separate windows.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.

Special-case less fear of initial 8-high enemy legions, to make AI move
   both legions out of tower in turn 1.

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.
