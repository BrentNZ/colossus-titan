Copy various new docs to web page from inst.  tex -> html first when possible.
Put web page under CVS.
Split up README into separate files.

Document test procedures.  

Add some JUnit tests.

ShowLegion on mouseover, not click, with permanent dialog.

Highlight appropriate engagement hex while engagement is being resolved.
   (Except during angel summoning.)

Make most returned collections unmodifiable.

Initialize autoPickRecruiter and overlays to true by default.

Optional post-engagement status dialog. 

Change some dialogs to show info in a label instead of the title (so
   the dialog is wide enough) and add explicit cancel buttons.

Move code to center a dialog on screen to one place.  Maybe add a
   parent dialog class?

Change StatusScreen to use a JTable.  
Pass smaller chunks of changed info to StatusScreen, from generalized
    info update messages. 

Cache legion heights, then known legion contents in Client.

Change remaining client->server information methods to void requests 
   and callbacks.

Cache known legion contents in Client.
Both require sending events to all clients when a legion is formed
    (game start or load), splits/joins, moves/unmoves, recruits/unrecruits, 
    reinforces, acquires, summons, dies (flees/concedes/negotiates/battles), 
    or gets reduced (by negotiation or battle).

Remove remaining public Client methods that only directly control the GUI
   in favor of higher-level events.

Always show the current turn, player, and phase in a panel somewhere.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, skipping recruits, ...)

If there is more than one human player, move the active player's
   map/board to the front.

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Add display of dead creatures / total creatures / creatures in play to
   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

Reveal all stacks at game end.

Allow players to specify that they automatically refuse to negotiate.  
   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

Prompt player whether to continue game after last human player dies
   if AIs remain.

Include an .ico file for Windows.

Remember window positions in .cfg file.

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Get minimax masterboard moves working.

When a stack flees, make the winning stack visible, to the fleeing
   legion's player's client only.  (Per-player rather than global
   stack visibility.)

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Write some design docs.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Show StatusScreen and ShowLegion info in the masterboard window, rather 
   than in separate windows.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.
