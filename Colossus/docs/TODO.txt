Add a window that shows the recruiting tree.

Version stamping, showing up in an About menu.

Allow dragging chits in addition to clicking source and destination.

Eliminate persistent legion.hexInfo and instead return a temporary
   object containing all the entry sides and teleport possibilities
   along with the possible hexes that the legion can move to.

Consider switching from make to Ant to better handle packages.

Confirmation prompt to avoid skipping recruits?

Split GUI classes from model classes.

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Get minimax masterboard moves working.

When a stack flees, make the winning stack visible, to the fleeing
   legion's player's client only.  (Per-player rather than global
   stack visibility.)

Make advance phase delay configurable.
Add AI time limits.

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Write some design docs.

Movement die should be displayed immediately when enabled, rather than
   waiting until the next turn, unless no movement die has been rolled
   yet.  Same for battle dice, which means always keeping the information
   up to date even if it's not being used.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.
Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add the ability to replace any creature in a legion with a different 
   creature type or "unknown," for PBEM and debug.

Change more modal dialogs to use a factory that returns a value,
   rather than a public constructor and a call to a mutator.
   This should reduce global access from dialogs to game objects,
   and allow dialog results to be more easily replicated by network
   and computer dialog replacements.  
All parameters passed into dialogs should be read-only or clones, with 
   all changes to game state done by the caller.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Highlight teleport and normal moves differently, and show entry sides.
Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there?

Color code StatusScreen better.

Show StatusScreen and ShowLegion info in the masterboard window, rather 
   than in separate windows.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Client-server networking.

Chat window.
