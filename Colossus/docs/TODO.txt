Make auto recruit smarter.  Take the correct small creature in a 
   tower, and take a third cyclops over a gorgon.

Add allow the ability to replace any creature in a legion with a 
   different creature type or "unknown," for PBEM and debug.

Add per-player option menu, with results saved to playername.cfg

Change more modal dialogs to use a factory that returns a value,
   rather than a public constructor and a call to a mutator.
   This should reduce global access from dialogs to game objects, 
   and allow dialog results to be more easily replicated by network 
   and computer dialog replacements.  All parameters passed into 
   the dialogs should eventually be read-only or clones, with all
   changes to game state done by the caller.

Add test main() to remaining dialogs.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add auto-forced-strike option.
Add auto-pick-legion-markers option.
Add auto-pick-entry-side option.
Add auto-MasterBoard-move option.
Add auto-BattleMap-move option.
Add auto-strike option.
Add auto-split option.
Add auto-flee option.
Add auto-play option.  (aka Really Dumb Computer Opponent.)

Add ability to specify computer opponents in GetPlayers.

Skip strikes that can't matter.

Add keyboard legion selection?
Add toolbars?
Add tooltips?

Should be able to undo moves until an engagement is resolved.
   If no engagements, should be able to undo recruits, then
   undo moves.  "Done with Engagements" shouldn't be necessary.

Highlight selected legion better. 
Highlight teleport and normal moves differently.
Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there?

Color code StatusScreen better.
Add the ability to choose towers, movement die rolls, and number of
   hits in combat, rather than rolling, for debug and tracking
   PBEM games.

Add the ability to change the creature type of a creature in a legion,
   and to specify "unknown" as a creature type, for tracking PBEM
   games.

All GUI method calls need to be moved out of non-GUI classes.
Split GUI classes from model classes.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Add a ShowAllRecruits window that displays all recruits by terrain 
   type.

Allow setting Look and Feel from a menu.

Add SetupBattle class, to allow setting up standalone battles.
