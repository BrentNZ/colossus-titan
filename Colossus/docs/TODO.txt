Bug: Remote player tower teleported, stack did not show up as moved until
   next turn's repaint.  Happens on many masterboard moves.

Bug: Remote player sees all of AI's possible battle moves.

Colorize StatusScreen.

Fix .java.policy file to allow as little as possible.
Add StartClient gui for setting playerName and hostname. 
Add .java.policy, change rmiserver to set a property to point to it.
Start rmiregistry from rmiserver?
Document RMI: .java.policy, rmiregistry (PATH)
Add Client.jnlp file.



Eliminate excess arguments to Flee, Concede, Negotiate.

Change all arguments to public Client/Server methods to String.  (Use a 
   proxy layer for this.)
Add raw socket interface.

Authenticate all remote calls to ensure that they come from the correct
   client or server.

Eliminate LegionInfo, PlayerInfo, Strike, Movement and instead use
   slightly different versions of Game, Legion, Player, Battle, etc. 
   on client side.

Set Client movementRoll when loading during movement phase after roll.

Add JUnit section to build docs.
Document test procedures.

Use SF project releases.

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F menu should indicate current L&F somehow, and not show Windows if not
   allowed on this platform.  
If player chose L&F from config file, it should be added to menu.
Kunststoff L&F in swing.properties file fails.  Works in player cfg file.
Add Kunststoff L&F to jar file?

Add explicit cancel buttons to more dialogs.  (PickRecruit)

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Remember window positions in player .cfg file.

Put old, new web pages under CVS.
Switch to new web page.

Include a Colossus.ico file for Windows.

ShowLegion on mouseover, not click, with permanent dialog.

Highlight appropriate engagement hex while engagement is being resolved.
   (Except during angel summoning.)

Initialize autoPickRecruiter and Show Graphical Overlays to true by default.

Optional post-engagement status dialog.

Always show the current turn, player, and phase in a panel somewhere.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, skipping recruits, ...)

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Add display of dead creatures / total creatures / creatures in play to
   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

Write more design docs.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Finish networked negotiation. 
Allow players to specify that they automatically refuse to negotiate.  
   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

Show StatusScreen and ShowLegion info in the masterboard window, rather 
   than in separate windows.

Special-case less fear of initial 8-high enemy legions, to make AI move
   both legions out of tower in turn 1.

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.
