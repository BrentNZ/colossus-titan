Set Client movementRoll when loading during movement phase after roll.

Add JUnit section to build docs.
Document test procedures.

Add remaining command-line options.  (User prefs dir?)

Use SF project releases.

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F menu should indicate current L&F somehow, and not show Windows if not
   allowed on this platform.  
If player chose L&F from config file, it should be added to menu.
Kunststoff L&F in swing.properties file fails.  Works in player cfg file.

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Add display of dead creatures / total creatures / creatures in play to
   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

Write more design docs.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Allow players to specify that they automatically refuse to negotiate.  
   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

   than in separate windows.

   moves, not just destination hex.

Special-case less fear of initial 8-high enemy legions, to make AI move
   both legions out of tower in turn 1.

   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.
