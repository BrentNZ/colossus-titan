Scale Theodore S. Hetke's chits down to 60x60.  Change code to
   only use one Titan.gif, and to invert chits in realtime rather
   than using i_*.gif?

Scale David Lum's markers up to 60x60.  Figure out a way to show
   legion height in a readable fashion.  (Contrasting color, 
   centered?)

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Centralize scale handling.  Add a rescale option.

Paint all chit names and numbers using fonts, to allow for
   better scaling?

Allow an arbitrary number of undo operations, rather than just one.

Add an option to show information about MasterBoard hexes when a
   mover is selected, such as whether that legion can recruit
   there, and how many die rolls from that hex would let the
   legion recruit next turn.

Add allow the ability to replace any creature in a legion with a 
   different creature type or "unknown," for PBEM and debug.

Add per-player option menu, with results saved to playername.cfg

Change more modal dialogs to use a factory that returns a value,
   rather than a public constructor and a call to a mutator.
   This should reduce global access from dialogs to game objects, 
   and allow dialog results to be more easily replicated by network 
   and computer dialog replacements.  All parameters passed into 
   the dialogs should eventually be read-only or clones, with all
   changes to game state done by the caller.

Add test main() to remaining dialogs.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add auto-forced-strike option.
Add auto-pick-entry-side option.
Add auto-MasterBoard-move option.
Add auto-BattleMap-move option.
Add auto-strike option.
Add auto-split option.
Add auto-flee option.
Add auto-play option.  (aka Really Dumb Computer Opponent.)

Add ability to specify computer opponents in GetPlayers.

Skip strikes that can't matter.

Add keyboard legion selection?
Add toolbars?
Add tooltips?

Should be able to undo moves until an engagement is resolved.
   If no engagements, should be able to undo recruits, then
   undo moves.  "Done with Engagements" shouldn't be necessary.

Highlight selected legion better. 
Highlight teleport and normal moves differently.
Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there?

Color code StatusScreen better.
Add the ability to choose towers, movement die rolls, and number of
   hits in combat, rather than rolling, for debug and tracking
   PBEM games.

Add the ability to change the creature type of a creature in a legion,
   and to specify "unknown" as a creature type, for tracking PBEM
   games.

All GUI method calls need to be moved out of non-GUI classes.
Split GUI classes from model classes.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Add a ShowAllRecruits window that displays all recruits by terrain 
   type.

Allow setting Look and Feel from a menu.

Add SetupBattle class, to allow setting up standalone battles.

Fix concession timing.

Client-server networking.

Add client config file to store default name, favorite colors, 
   favorite servers, etc.

Chat window.
