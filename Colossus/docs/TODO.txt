Make most returned collections unmodifiable. 

Cache known legion contents in Client.
Cache hex location of each legion in Client.
Both require sending events to all clients when a legion is formed
    (game start or load), splits/joins, moves/unmoves, recruits/unrecruits, 
    reinforces, acquires, summons, dies (flees/concedes/negotiates/battles), 
    or gets reduced (by negotiation or battle).

Always show the current turn, player, and phase in a panel somewhere.

If there is more than one human player, move the active player's
   map/board to the front.
Call toBack() on the map/board to move the other one to the front.
   (Less obnoxious than toFront() when other applications are running.)

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Add display of dead creatures / total creatures / creatures in play to
   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.
Add total value of all a player's creatures to StatusScreen.

Reveal all stacks at game end.

Optionally show the contents of a legion that flees or concedes.

Allow players to specify that they automatically refuse to negotiate.  
   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

Prompt player whether to continue game after last human player dies
   if AIs remain.

Reduce imports between client and server packages.  Document remaining 
   public classes, which are those that need to be included in the 
   network protocol.

Include an .ico file for Windows.

Remember window positions in .cfg file.

Show just-recruited enemy critters on top of their stacks.

Confirmation prompt to avoid skipping recruits?

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Get minimax masterboard moves working.

When a stack flees, make the winning stack visible, to the fleeing
   legion's player's client only.  (Per-player rather than global
   stack visibility.)

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Write some design docs.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Show StatusScreen and ShowLegion info in the masterboard window, rather 
   than in separate windows.

Client-server networking.

Chat window.
