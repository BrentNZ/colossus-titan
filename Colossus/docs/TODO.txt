Bug: Chat window went modal and started beeping.  Killing it from the
   Graphics menu worked.

Bug: Logic to keep ShowLegion fully onscreen also failing on RH 7.3, 1.4.0,
   Sawfish at 1600x1200

Bug: 2-high titan stack did not run away even though it could be caught
   on 4-6 by a 6-high stack:
Gold rolls a 4 for movement
considering risk of leaving Gd01 in Brush hex 109
got enemies that can attack on a 1 :[Rd04]
got enemies that can attack on a 2 :[Rd04, Rd11]
got enemies that can attack on a 3 :[Rd04, Rd11]
got enemies that can attack on a 4 :[Rd02, Rd04, Rd11]
got enemies that can attack on a 5 :[Rd01, Rd02, Rd04, Rd11]
got enemies that can attack on a 6 :[Rd01, Rd02, Rd04, Rd11]
EVAL Gd01 stay in Brush hex 109 = 0
considering risk of moving Gd01 to Plains hex 105
got enemies that can attack on a 5 :[Bu03]
got enemies that can attack on a 6 :[Bu03]
EVAL Gd01 move to Plains hex 105 = 0

Bug: The duplicate name detection code for network players is now
   failing with the new initialization timing -- oscillating fixNames
   between dripton and dripton4

Bug: Saw 8-high enemy legion 3xUni, Chi, 3xGri, Ran.  Height shows up
   as 7 on marker.  Savegame shows no ranger.  Should be fixed by
   stack prediction code.

Bug: Got two "All humans eliminated" dialogs -- one for human and one
   for last AI.  (With stop when all humans eliminated option set.)
   Eliminated the dialog.  Put back?

Disable "AIs stop when humans dead" if no human players at start of game.

Add link from client to LogWindow; advance scroll thumb at end of various
   phases. 

Should be able to clear recruitChits in any phase.  Move to Graphics menu?

Real whole-legion battle eval function, including gang hits.

Ability to dismiss and recall recruit markers.

Finish split prediction.

Refactor to eliminate duplicate code.

Machine learning to tweak AI constants.

Improve networking.  (Persistent servers, reporting game openings to web page.)

When getting both a PickRecruit and an AcquireAngel after a battle,
   make sure the PickRecruit is on top, because it's modal.
   Or make PickRecruit non-modal.

Colorize chat window.

Observer clients.

Sometimes refuse remote newGame/loadGame/saveGame calls?

Cleanup network shutdown -- when game over or player eliminated, don't
   whine if its client drops.

Set Client movementRoll when loading during movement phase after roll.
Set which legions have recruited when loading during recruit phase.

Use SF project releases.

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F should not show Windows if not allowed on this platform.
Kunststoff L&F in swing.properties file fails.  Works in player cfg file.
Add Kunststoff L&F to jar file?

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Put old, new web pages under CVS.
Switch to new XWeb web page.

Include a Colossus.ico file for Windows.

ShowLegion on mouseover, not click, with permanent dialog.
Show zoomed area around mouse cursor in a small window, for Abyssal9.

Highlight appropriate engagement hex while engagement is being resolved.
   (Except during angel summoning.)  Also just after battle, while showing:
Optional post-engagement status dialog.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, skipping recruits, ...)

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

XML game log, replacing flat-file savegames.  Need to find a small XML
   parser for JDK 1.3 users.

Write more design docs.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.
