Unify command-line argument processing on client and server sides.

Add link from client to LogWindow; advance scroll thumb at end of various
   phases. 

More AI delays within phases (between moves, strikes, etc.). 

Should be able to clear recruitChits in any phase.  Move to Graphics menu?

Real whole-legion battle eval function, including gang hits.

Ability to dismiss and recall recruit markers.

Finish split prediction.

Refactor to eliminate duplicate code.

Machine learning to tweak AI constants.

Improve networking.  (Persistent servers, reporting game openings to web page.)

When getting both a PickRecruit and an AcquireAngel after a battle,
   make sure the PickRecruit is on top, because it's modal.
   Or make PickRecruit non-modal.

Colorize chat window.

Colorize StatusScreen.

Observer clients.

Sometimes refuse remote newGame/loadGame/saveGame calls?

Cleanup network shutdown -- when game over or player eliminated, don't
   whine if its client drops.

Set Client movementRoll when loading during movement phase after roll.
Set which legions have recruited when loading during recruit phase.

Use SF project releases.

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F should not show Windows if not allowed on this platform.
Kunststoff L&F in swing.properties file fails.  Works in player cfg file.
Add Kunststoff L&F to jar file?

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Put old, new web pages under CVS.
Switch to new XWeb web page.

ShowLegion on mouseover, not click, with permanent dialog.

Highlight appropriate engagement hex while engagement is being resolved.
   (Except during angel summoning.)

Optional post-engagement status dialog.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, skipping recruits, ...)

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Write more design docs.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.
