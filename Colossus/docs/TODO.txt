Use SF project releases.

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F menu should indicate current L&F somehow, and not show Windows if not
   allowed on this platform.  
If player chose L&F from config file, it should be added to menu.

   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

Write more design docs.

   type, player scores for titan power.)

   legion markers.

   both legions out of tower in turn 1.

   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
