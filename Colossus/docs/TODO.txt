Add unit tests for server options.
Add JUnit section to build docs.
Document test procedures.

Add remaining command-line options.

Save/load/test scale.

Validate LOS for level 3 hexes in Badlands-JDG.

Bug: All stacks visible is broken.

Bug: Own legions not always shown sorted.

Bug: Undo move with a recruitChit showing, not cleared.

Bug: Still getting excess Acquire dialog, for 6-high legion that earns two
   angels, but at least angel is not added.

Bug: Non-overlay terrain layers shown a bit too far to the right.

Bug: No T2T teleport on first turn only works for first player?

Bug: Need to redo caretaker stack display when "Use black overlay on Chits"
   is flipped.

Bug: Chit-sized white space over map's terrain label in top left corner of
   map.  Minimize/restore doesn't fix.  Presumably a null chit is being 
   painted.

Bug: All AIs forced to SimpleAI on load game.  Need to save final ai type
   in savegame, not "A Random AI"

Change Quit button in GetPlayers dialog to Cancel.  Go back to existing 
   game if there is one from Cancel, or quit if just starting.  Eliminate
   confirmation before calling dialog.

L&F menu should indicate current L&F somehow, and not show Windows if not
   allowed on this platform.  Test with kunstoff in properties file.

Add explicit cancel buttons to more dialogs.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Add UI for setting server options before starting game.
Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Remember window positions in player .cfg file.

Send creature list, summonable list, recruit tree, etc. to clients at startup.

Put old, new web pages under CVS.
Switch to new web page.

Include a Colossus.ico file for Windows.

ShowLegion on mouseover, not click, with permanent dialog.

Highlight appropriate engagement hex while engagement is being resolved.
   (Except during angel summoning.)

Initialize autoPickRecruiter and Show Graphical Overlays to true by default.

Optional post-engagement status dialog.

Remove remaining public Client methods that only directly control the GUI
   in favor of higher-level events.

Always show the current turn, player, and phase in a panel somewhere.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, skipping recruits, ...)

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Add display of dead creatures / total creatures / creatures in play to
   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.

Reveal all stacks at game end.

Write more design docs.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Finish networked negotiation. 
Allow players to specify that they automatically refuse to negotiate.  
   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

Show StatusScreen and ShowLegion info in the masterboard window, rather 
   than in separate windows.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.

Special-case less fear of initial 8-high enemy legions, to make AI move
   both legions out of tower in turn 1.

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.
