Get per-player options working right through clients.  Currently all players
   seem to be using first player's options.

Stuff to move out of Game:
   All direct references to GUI classes.  (Go through Server and Client.
   Use static stuff at first for simplicity, and make it per-client later.)

Try to split the non-GUI stuff out of map/board/*hex into separate classes.

highlight* methods should move down to Client or MasterBoard/BattleMap.

Move BattleChits to client side.


Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Get minimax masterboard moves working.

Add a configurable AI move delay to make it easier to follow what the
   AI is doing.
Add AI time limits.
Add AI progress indicator.

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

AI: Consider recruit scarcity (last gargoyle possibly more valuable than 
   troll).  Don't cheat and peek at opposing stacks unless all stacks 
   are visible or some cheat option is set.  Give some value to sitting in 
   native terrain.  Get scrub snacks out of nearby opponents' good 
   recruiting terrain and into blocking positions.

Write some design docs.

Movement die should be displayed immediately when enabled, rather than
   waiting until the next turn, unless no movement die has been rolled
   yet.  Same for battledice.

Separate the GUI parts of MasterBoard/MasterHex/BattleMap/BattleHex
   from the game state parts.
Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.
Add a ShowAllRecruits window that displays all recruits by terrain type.
Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)
Add show caretaker stacks / show graveyard dialogs.  (From Prometheus.)

Should be able to undo moves until an engagement is resolved.
   If no engagements, should be able to undo recruits, then
   undo moves.  "Done with Engagements" shouldn't be necessary.
   Basically, phases should be less rigid.

Add an option to show information about MasterBoard hexes when a
   mover is selected, such as whether that legion can recruit
   there, and how many die rolls from that hex would let the
   legion recruit next turn.

Add the ability to replace any creature in a legion with a different 
   creature type or "unknown," for PBEM and debug.

Change more modal dialogs to use a factory that returns a value,
   rather than a public constructor and a call to a mutator.
   This should reduce global access from dialogs to game objects,
   and allow dialog results to be more easily replicated by network
   and computer dialog replacements.  
All parameters passed into dialogs should be read-only or clones, with 
   all changes to game state done by the caller.

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)

Add keyboard legion/critter selection?  (Previous, next, unselect keys)
Add toolbars?
Add tooltips?

Highlight selected legion better.
Highlight teleport and normal moves differently.
Differently-highlight hexes where a legion could move if
   a friendly stack were not already there?

Color code StatusScreen better.

Add the ability to change the creature type of a creature in a legion,
   and to specify "unknown" as a creature type, for tracking PBEM games.

All GUI method calls need to be moved out of non-GUI classes.
Split GUI classes from model classes.

Move GUI/client classes and model/server classes into separate
   packages.  Make all possible public classes package private.
   Document remaining public classes, which are those that
   need to be included in the network protocol.

Fix concession timing.

Client-server networking.

Chat window.  (From Prometheus.)
