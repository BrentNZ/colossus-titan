Document test procedures.  

Add some JUnit tests.

Copy all docs to web page from inst target.

Put web page under CVS.

Set up Java2html for current release source on web site.

Highlight appropriate engagement hex while engagement is being resolved.
   (Except during angel summoning.)

Make most returned collections unmodifiable.

Initialize autoPickRecruiter, overlays to true by default.

Show just-recruited enemy critters on top of their stacks.

Optional post-engagement status dialog showing which legions/players
   fought, known stack contents, what lived and died, summons, acquires,
   reinforcements, and points.

Change some dialogs to show info in a label instead of the title (so
   the dialog is wide enough) and add explicit cancel buttons.

Move code to center a dialog on screen to one place.  Maybe add a
   parent dialog class?

Change StatusScreen to use a JTable.

Cache hex location of each legion in Client.
Cache known legion contents in Client.
Both require sending events to all clients when a legion is formed
    (game start or load), splits/joins, moves/unmoves, recruits/unrecruits, 
    reinforces, acquires, summons, dies (flees/concedes/negotiates/battles), 
    or gets reduced (by negotiation or battle).
Change client->server information methods to void requests and callbacks.

Remove public Client methods that only affect the GUI, e.g. unselectAllHexes()
   in favor of higher-level events.

Always show the current turn, player, and phase in a panel somewhere.

Add confirm dialogs (for conceding with titan, ...)

If there is more than one human player, move the active player's
   map/board to the front.
Call toBack() on the map/board to move the other one to the front.
   (Less obnoxious than toFront() when other applications are running.)

Make BattleMap less tall.
Highlight entrances somehow.  Maybe use fixed boxes with an arrow to
   show entry side, instead of cascading.

Add display of dead creatures / total creatures / creatures in play to
   CreatureCollectionView, and some way to toggle between these values.
Add total value of all a player's creatures to StatusScreen.

Reveal all stacks at game end.

Allow players to specify that they automatically refuse to negotiate.  
   Check for this before showing negotiation dialog to opponent.

Prompt player whether to continue game after last human player dies
   if AIs remain.

Include an .ico file for Windows.

Remember window positions in .cfg file.

Confirmation prompt to avoid skipping recruits?

Add UI for players to specify favorite colors.

Get minimax masterboard moves working.

When a stack flees, make the winning stack visible, to the fleeing
   legion's player's client only.  (Per-player rather than global
   stack visibility.)

Improve mapping of terrain types, creature nativity, and creature
   recruiting potential so that the AI can easily take these into
   account.

Write some design docs.

Make MasterBoard and MasterHex pluggable.  Integrate David Lum's
   Java2D MasterBoard graphics as an option.

Add a ShowLegionMarkers window that shows each player's remaining 
   legion markers.

Add SetupBattle dialog, to allow setting up standalone battles.  
   (terrain, entry side, creatures in attacking and defending legions,
   angel/archangel available to summon, recruits available for terrain
   type, player scores for titan power.)

Add "no 2s or 5s" mulligan option.  (Per player, or global, or both?)
Add optional additional handicap mulligans that can be used after turn 1.

Show StatusScreen and ShowLegion info in the masterboard window, rather 
   than in separate windows.

Client-server networking.

Chat window.

Add movement and recruit animation.  Requires returning full paths for
   moves, not just destination hex.



Bug: Can't change player options during battle when attacked by another
     player, only during own turn.
Bug: AI player rolls 6 on turn 1, fails several teleport moves, takes normal
     move.  Not passing teleport=true to Game.doMove() ? 
Bug: Angel acquiring is broken.  Default variant.
