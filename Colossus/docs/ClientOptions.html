<h1>Options on client side (MasterBoard window)</h1>

<FONT color="red"><B>NOTE: The "preferences type" options have been moved
to a "Preferences" window <BR>- this document has not been updated yet
to reflect those changes [2008-01-04].</B></FONT>
<P>
This document is a start to describe the meaning/purpose of the
different available options on client side, i.e. what you (every
individual player/client) can select/modify from the Menu bar in the
"MasterBoard" window during the game.
<P>For the game-global option that can only be set during game setup
see the <A HREF="GetPlayersOptions.html">Get Players startup dialog</A> page.
<p>
The menubar provides the following menus:
<UL>
<li><A HREF="#FileMenu">File menu</A>
<li><A HREF="#PhaseMenu">Phase menu</A>
<li><A HREF="#AutoplayMenu">Autoplay menu</A>
<li><A HREF="#GraphicsMenu">Graphics menu</A>
<li><A HREF="#WindowMenu">Window menu</A>
<li><A HREF="#HelpMenu">Help menu</A>
</UL>

The different menus are described in detail in the sections below.
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="#FileMenu">File menu</A></H2>


These are the usual options you would expect from most applications:
<UL>
<LI><B>New game</B></LI>
<LI><B>Load game</B></LI>
<LI><B>Save game</B></LI>
<LI><B>Save game as</B></LI>
<LI><B>Quit</B></LI>
</UL>
<B>Save game</B> and <B>Save game as</B> will save the current state
of the game to a xml file in a subdirectory "saves" in "the colossus
directory"; this colossus directory is generally speaking, a directory
called ".colossus" in your "home directory". Whatever this home
directory is, depends on your operating system. For Unix and Linux
users this should be clear; under Windows XP this is something
like "C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;your login name&gt;"; other
versions of Microsoft Windows use different directories...
<P>
Colossus tells you the directory it considers to be your home directory under
<A HREF="#HelpAbout"><B>Help - About</B><A/> (it shows it in the line 
with "users.home").

<P>
<B>Save game</B> will automatically generate some numeric, for human
not meaningful filename (same as the Autosave option in Settings in 
<A HREF="GetPlayersOptions.html#Autosave">Get Players startup dialog)</A>;
with <B>Save game as</B> you are prompted
with a file selection box to provide a name for the file (with XML
ending).
<P>
Games saved this way can be loaded later using the <B>Load game</B>
menu option or with the <B>Load game</B> button in the Player
Selection menu (on game start).
<P>
<B><FONT color="red">NOTE: Right now loading games that were saved
during the middle of a phase (in particular when a battle is ongoing),
might cause trouble or not work at all.</B></FONT> Thus you should try
to save always at the beginning of a user's turn or at least at the
beginning of a phase.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Once you select <B>New Game</B> and click "Yes" in the
following confirmation dialog, your currently running game is
aborted. I.e. even if you then in the upcoming player selection dialog
click "Quit": this does not bring you back to the game (even though it
is still visible in the background!!) - rather it will terminate the
whole Java application. This might be changed in (far ;-) future to
allow a "Cancel" to return back to the ongoing game.
<P>Loading a game that involves network (=remote) players is possible,
but one has to do it "exactly the right way" - see the FAQ in
 <A HREF="network.html">Networked Colossus</A> (at the bottom of page).
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="#PhaseMenu">Phase menu</A></H2>

This menu provides some actions affecting your current game phase: 
<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="#Phase_ClearRecruitChits">Clear recruit chits</A></B></LI>
<LI><B><A HREF="#Phase_Undo">Undo</A></B></LI>
<LI><B><A HREF="#Phase_UndoAll">Undo All</A></B></LI>
<LI><B><A HREF="#Phase_Done">Done</A></B></LI>
<LI><B><A HREF="#Phase_TakeMulligan">Take Mulligan</A></B></LI>
<LI><B><A HREF="#Phase_WithdrawFromGame">Withdraw from Game</A></B></LI>
</UL>

Which of those are at a certain moment available and what they do might
depend on the situation, in which current game phase you are (Split,
Move, Resolve Engagements, Muster Recruits).
<P>
This means also, when it is currently not your turn, this menu is
disabled.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="#Phase_ClearRecruitChits">Phase - Clear recruit Chits</A></H3> 
During the muster phase of the individual players, small chits will
appear on the different legions stacks (on top of the legion marker),
indicating which creature that legion did recruit recently. They will
automatically cleared up in the moment when your own mustering phase
starts. Before that, they are all there and might hinder your sight -
for example, you don't see the number indicating the height of your
own or the other player's legions; sometimes this information would be
useful to see when deciding about whether to split. With this menu
item (or just pressing "C") you can make the recruit chits disappear
at nearly any time you want.
<P>
There is no way to call them back (right now).
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> above it says "at nearly any time" - because, if you
press "C" while a "do you want to concede?"-dialog is open, this "C"
would be taken as answer to the dialog. There's room for improvement
here...

<H3><A NAME="#Phase_Undo">Phase - Undo</A></H3> 

This will undo the last action you did (split, recruit, or moving a
legion).

<H3><A NAME="#Phase_UndoAll">Phase - Undo All</A></H3> 

This undoes all of the done actions of this phase, i.e. it resets you
to the beginning of this phase. There is no way to go back to previous
phases.

<H3><A NAME="#Phase_Done">Phase - Done</A></H3> 

This will end the current phase, and being done with the "Muster
Recruits" phase will end your turn; thus the next player can start his
turn then.

<H3><A NAME="#Phase_TakeMulligan">Phase - Take Mulligan</A></H3>

This allows to take a Mulligan, i.e. re-rolling the movement
dice. This is only available during the movement phase, and according
to normal Titan rules only once and only in first turn.
<P>
(In the Player Selection during the Game startup, the tab
<B>Options</B>, exists an option <B>Unlimited Mulligans</B> - with
this selected the <B>Take Mulligan</B> action will be allowed during
any turn, as many times as one wants. Good for practicing purposes :)

<H3><A NAME="#Phase_WithdrawFromGame">Phase - Withdraw from game</A></H3>

Will remove you cleanly from the game.
<P>
As said, the Phase menu is disabled when it's not your turn.  Arguably
the <B>Withdraw from Game</B> might be useful to be available at any
time, but current implementation does not allow it... one would need
to check first if withdrawing at whatever other point might cause
problems in the client/server synchronization (to the other, remaining
clients); as long as this is not checked it stays as it is. If you
just close your window in a very unlucky moment the game *might* hang
for the remaining players :-(

<P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="#AutoplayMenu">Autoplay menu</A></H2>

Here are several options that you can make the game automatically do
certain tasks for you; they would then be done mostly the same way as the
SimpleAI would do it.

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#Auto_pick_color">Auto pick color</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#Auto_pick_markers">Auto pick markers</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#Auto_pick_entry_sides">Auto pick entry sides</A></LI>

<LI><A HREF="#Auto_reinforce">Auto reinforce</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#Auto_play">Auto play</A></LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_pick_color">Autoplay - Auto pick color</A></H3>
During begin of the game, you are asked to select a color. If you don't care which color you get, mark this option.
<P>
<B>Tip for "hacker-type" users:</B>
There is the possibility to put a line in the Options file, what your favorite (=preferred) colors are; then this option will try to give you one of those preferred colors (if possible - if you are the last of several human players to choose and the previous players picked all of those colors, you still get a random color). Human players have precedence before AI players.
<P>
Unfortunately there is (so far) no menu functionality to put this
preferred color to the Options file. The file in question is
normally called <BR>
<PRE>  Colossus-&lt;your player name&gt;.cfg</PRE> 
and it is located in the .colossus directory mentioned above.
You would need to manually add a line *exactly* like this:
<PRE>
  Favorite\ colors=Green,Black,Orange
</PRE>
to that file, to get (if possible) one of those colors.
Note the backslash before the space, and the proper spelling (case-sensitive!) of the color names, and no spaces around the comma!
<P>
Such a change must be done while Colossus is not running - otherwise, when Colossus ends it will write back the options/settings you possibly modified during the game (and thus wiping out the manual editing of the file).
<P>
Perhaps one day someone makes a GUI functionality for this...

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_pick_markers">Autoplay - Auto pick markers</A></H3>
If you don't care which marker will be taken for splitting a legion, mark this option - it will just pick one by random.

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_pick_entry_sides">Autoplay - Auto pick entry sides</A></H3>

When teleporting or when there is more than one path how you can reach
a certain target land to attack an enemy legion there, you have to choose
from which side you want to enter. For example, from
Woods 30 with a movement roll of 5 or 6, you can get to the Desert 35
directly (entering from left), or going around (entering from bottom).
This makes only a difference if the target land is occupied by another
player's legion, i.e. there will be an engagement.
<P>
Normally you would be prompted to pick the entry side; this option
automatically picks one side for you.

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_forced_strike">Autoplay - Auto forced strike</A></H3>

Creatures engaged in a battle with exactly one opponent creature,
can naturally only strike that opponent creature, and this strike is
mandatory - thus this option would automatically do all those strikes.
It leaves the one where there is more than one possible strike target
for you. (Those are still mandatory, but it's your choice where to strike).

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_carry_single">Autoplay - Auto carry single</A></H3>

Similar to the above, if there is only one possible carry target for excess hits (more hits than needed to kill the primary target).

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_angestrike_single">Autoplay - Auto rangestrike single</A></H3>

Similar to the above, if there is only one possible rangestrike
target.  One notable difference is, rangestrikes are not mandatory -
there might be rare situations where you do not want to use all
rangestrikes; if you play with such subtle strategy skills, in this
case you should not use this option.

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_summon_angels">Autoplay - Auto summon angels</A></H3>

Will automatically decide whether to summon an angel, and if so, which
one.  It uses the AI functionality for the decision whether to summon.
There might be situations when you want not to summon (especially the
after battle summon), e.g. to muster something stronger
instead. Usually the AI should decide "right" in this case but...

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_acquire angels">Autoplay - Auto acquire angels</A></H3>

Will automatically acquire the angel(s) after a won battle. Uses also
 the AI functionality to decide whether to acquire (or not, e.g. to
have still space for a possible stronger recruit).
<P>
If you want full control - don't use this. Then you will be prompted.

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_recruit">Autoplay - Auto recruit</A></H3>

This will, at the beginning of your Muster Recruits phase, already
select one recruit for every legion that can do so. <B>This speeds up
the game enormously</B>, since in the majority of cases it will pick
for you the one you would pick anyway, and you can review already
during your movement phase what you would get there (but see note
below).
<P>
And you can then always override the choice this automatic mode had
made for you - same as how you could undo and redo any other of the
recruit choices you made yourself.  Just click the legion once (then
the chit disappears and nothing is mustered) and click again to get
the "Pick recruit" dialog.
<P>
This auto recruit will usually pick the "best" possible recruit -
which is in most (but not in all!) cases the "strongest" possible one;
the best might instead be something that we call a "recruit hint". For
example, if you have two Lions, no griffon yet, you are in a plains,
and a Desert is in reach, then you could take a Lion or a Ranger: in
this case the recruit hint is to take the Lion (not the Ranger), to
enable you to get then in the Desert the griffon.  
<P>
(Naturally someone might want to take the 3rd Lion even if no Desert
is directly in reach [with one dice roll], but the situation above is
how the hint is written and how thus the AIs play.)
<P>
<B>See under <A HREF="#RecruitPreviewChits">Graphics - Show
recruit preview chits...</A> for some related details</B>!
<P>
<B><FONT color="red">NOTE: There are some very rare cases, where the
actual pick recruit will pick something different than what the
recruit preview (during move phase) showed, even in "Recruit hint"
mode.  Details see also under the "Show recruit preview chits..."
description.</B></FONT> I hope to tackle this one day...


<H3><A NAME="#Auto_pick_recruiters">Autoplay - Auto pick recruiters</A></H3>

When you have several different creatures that allow you to muster a
new recruit, you have to decide which creatures to reveal to the other
players - what entitles you to muster a certain creature: for example,
do you take the Cyclops with the two Gargoyles or the Cyclops you
already have?
<P>
If you don't care what is revealed, for example if every player can
peek into everyone's legions anyway (most people play like this, and
that is the default mode), it's just convenient to let the game just
pick whatever choice for you.
<P>
If, at the other hand, you play with the option setting "Only own
legions" (see option "Viewable legion content" in <A
HREF="GetPlayersOptions.html#Viewable_legion_content">Setting in Get
Players startup dialog</A>), i.e. as close to "real board game Titan
possible", you might want to have control what is revealed and not use this
option.

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_reinforce">Autoplay - Auto reinforce</A></H3>

Will automatically decide whether and which reinforcement to take during 
a battle.

<H3><A NAME="#Auto_play">Autoplay - Auto play</A></H3>

This will automatically play for you - everything. It will play with
the same logic as the SimpleAI plays. Note that this "play like an AI"
also affects to certain other behavior aspects. For example, you will
not get the "Game over, XXX wins" dialog.
<P>
After selecting this option (when it is currently already your turn),
<B>you still have to do one action (split or move one legion, or press
the Done button)</B> before the AI kicks in and continues.  If you
enable this while it is currently another player's turn the AI should
start automatically play for you once your turn starts. 
<FONT color="red">(Enabling it during a battle does <B>not</B> work).</FONT>
<P>
Unlike all other options, this one here is not saved in your user options!
<P>
If it would be saved, or you would put it manually there, when the
game starts your player won't even get a MasterBoard (nor any other
window... perhaps the AutoInspector window, but that's a bug ;-) - this
is, because this player is treated like an AI client then, and AIs simply do not get a board.
<P>
One possible use case for this is, if you play with several
remote/network players and you have to postpone the game to another
date. At that new date some player might not have time, or not be
interested to continue. In this case, one of the remaining players can
start another network client (on his own machine!) in place of the
missing one, and mostly immediatey set this client to <B>Auto
play</B>. You will then get an additional window, but you can minimize
that and it should not bother too much. Better than not be able to
play at all.
<P>
<B>Tip for "hacker-type" users:</B> For the missing-player scenario,
you can even modify the saved .xml file and replace there the player
type "Human" with something else, like "SimpleAI" or
"RationalAI". (Technical implementation of this file may change, or
perhaps may never change, but right now, technically there is no problem to
do this trick). Then you don't even get the superfluous window(s).
<P>

<H2><A NAME="#GraphicsMenu">Graphics menu</A></H2>

All these settings somehow effect the graphics - what or how something
is shown. The first group are all kind of just optical differences - which colors, rounded corners and such.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#Antialias">Antialias</A></LI>

</UL>
The remaining two items are not just "optical", but make a difference
in the content, i.e. which type of information is shown to you in a
certain situation.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#UncertainAsBlank">Uncertain as blank (Autoinspector etc.)</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#RecruitPreviewChits">Show recruit preview chits...</A></LI>
</UL>

Okay, here the detailed descriptions for both groups:

<H3><A NAME="#Antialias">Antialias</A></H3>

Slightly different showing of some corners of something ... *shrug*

<H3><A NAME="#UseGraphicalOverlay">Use Graphical Overlay</A></H3>

The different lands on the masterboard can just be a base color and a
text printed in it, or show some fancy small graphical "overlay" picture, 
resembling the picture in original Titan masterboard.
<P>
Until recently changing this setting took only effect after a rescale, 
should be fixed now (2007 July).

<H3><A NAME="#UseSvgChits">Use SVG chits</A></H3>

Some different graphics files used for some purposes - anyone knowing
details here?

<H3><A NAME="#BlackOverlayChits">Use black overlay on Chits</A></H3>

Print the name and values (skill and power) on creatures in black
rather than in the creature's color.
<P>
After changing this only newly added chits will look different. The
ones already visible on the board do not change immediately...

<H3><A NAME="#ColoredBordersChits">Use colored borders on Battle Chits</A></H3>

As name says. [does it actually work?]

<H3><A NAME="#NotInvertBattleChits">Do not invert defender's Battle Chits</A></H3>

Normally defender's battle chits are shown upside down, so that one can distinct
attacker and defender. With this setting they are not upside down.

<H3><A NAME="#hideAdjStrikeDiceRangeStrike">
       Hide Adjustments to Dice for Rangestrike</A>
</H3>

From the <i>Law of Titan</i> rulebook: "The number of dice thrown in a
rangestrike is determined by the character's Range-strength, which is
equal to one half the character's Power-factor, rounded down."
<P>
In Colossus, when you click on a creature that is able to strike or
rangestrike a red die indicating the roll needed for a successful hit will be
displayed on each creature in range.
<P>If the number of dice to be rolled for striking a certain creature is 
different than the striker's power-factor (e.g. due to hazards or rangestrike)
a GREEN number will be displayed over a second, blue/red die on that creature.
<P>
With this setting the dice-adjustment number will not be displayed 
if the difference to the striker's power factor is just the "half of
the power factor due to rangestrike" adjustment.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
And now the two "content"-affecting ones:

<H3><A NAME="#UncertainAsBlank">Uncertain as blank (Autoinspector
etc.)</A></H3> 

This option is only available if you play with the setting/mode
 "Ever revealed (or concludable) since start" 
(see option "Viewable legion content" in 
<A HREF="GetPlayersOptions.html#Viewable_legion_content">Setting in Get
Players startup dialog</A>). For the other two modes ("Only own
legions" and "True content for all legions") this option is simply
irrelevant/not meaningful, thus then it is inactive (greyed out).
<P>
In the "Ever revealed ..." mode, some creatures had been revealed, and some
others might be safely concluded (= are "certain") to be in a particular
legion you are looking at - e.g. with Autoinspector, or right-clicking
a legion marker.
<P>
For the remaining ones, the game always calculates some "best guess" -
what is most likely to be there; but this information is just a guess,
not "certain".  Depending on this setting, for the uncertain ones are
then either shown the best guess (with a question mark over them), or
if <B>Uncertain as blank</B> is selected, it just shows a "blank" (=no
creature), only a question mark.
<P>
The rationale behind this is, if the best guess is shown, one might be
influenced by it, unconciously trusting it, and be fooled by it. Also sometimes
the question mark is easily overlooked on some creatures.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="#RecruitPreviewChits">Show
recruit preview chits...</A></H3>

When you click on a legion to move somewhere, lands light up where this
legion can move to. In those lands are then shown small chits denoting which
creatures this legion could muster there. This is called the recruit preview.
<P>
This submenu offers 4 different (multiple exlusive) settings to decide
what is shown as recruit preview.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>None</B> - Nothing is shown. Not sure if anyone needs this...</LI>
<LI><B>Strongest</B> - The "strongest" possible recruit is shown (see below).</LI>
<LI><B>Recruit hint</B> - A "recruit hint" is shown (see below).</LI>
<LI><B>All</B> - All possible recruits (that this legion could get there) are shown.</LI>
</UL>
<H4>"Strongest" vs. "Recruit Hint"</H4>

Earlier there was only a setting "Show all recruit chits [or not]", and when not selected 
that recruit preview showed then only one, the best recruit ... 
but what is "the best", depends on the point of view.
<P>
<B>Strongest</B> is the one which is highest position in the recruit tree of that land (visible with right click in that land, or autoinspector),
which is not in all cases the same as the one with the highest point value 
(skill * power). Most notifiably in Tower, Warlock has point value 20, Guardian has 24,
still Warlock is the one highest in the tree, so with this setting "Strongest"
you will (given you are eligible both for Guardian and Warlock) 
always be shown the Warlock (except in some exotic variants, perhaps).
<P>
This is also the setting which was in effect all the last years when there was
only the option "Show all recruit chits" (or not) and that was not selected -
it just showed the highest from the recruit tree. Which often was the same as what
autorecruit would take, but not always (see <A HREF="#PreviewVsAutorecruit">
Recruit preview vs. Auto recruit</A> below).
<P>
<B>Recruit hint</B> shows, well, a recruit hint - a suggestion, what would be best
to take now considering "long term strategy". 
<P>
For the different variants, there are (or can be) recruit hints. They suggest
to take, depending on (beside other things) land, creatures in the legion,
lands in reach etc., to take something different than "simply the strongest".
Only if there is no special hint, this hint defaults to the strongest.
<P>
Examples for such hints are, as under auto recruit already mentioned:
<UL>
<LI>Take a third Lion instead Ranger (to get later Griffon)</LI>
<LI>Take a third Troll instead of Ranger (to get later Wyvern)</LI>
<LI>Similar 3rd Centaur, 3rd Ogre, 3rd Cyclops</LI>
</UL>
Other variants might have more, exotic combinations.
<P>
These hints are used also by the AI players to decide what to take.

<H4><FONT color="red"><A NAME="#PreviewVsAutorecruit">Recruit preview vs. Auto recruit</A></FONT></H4>

Since the AIs behave mostly according to those hints, and Autoplay
options (Auto Recruit, in this case) behave like an AI, this recruit
hint preview mode <B>basically</B> (but see below) tells you which
creature the auto recruit will take then in the recruit phase. Using
this Auto recruit speeds up the game enormously: you can review
already during your move phase what you would get there, and during
the muster phase auto recruit picks that - in most cases this will be
the one you would pick anyway. Thus you basically need only to do
something special when you notice during move "ok, it suggests the
Ranger but I <B>want</B> a Lion!"; and <B>only in this case</B>
remember to change the recruitee in your recruit phase then for this
one or two legions.
<P>
(Comment 1: Unfortunately it happens, that when there are engagements, after them,
thus several minutes later, one has forgotten that one wanted to override
the auto recruit decition. Make a node to your ear to remind yourself of it  ;-)
<P>
(Comment 2: I have a plan to, one day, implement some real "recruit already during move"
functionality, but this still needs to consider the "after engagement situation may have changed"
situation - due to the "according to the rules muster happen after the engagements").
<p>
Above it says <B>basically</B>, because there are rare situations
where this differs.  <B><FONT color="red">Thus Auto recruit would then
pick something else than what was shown as preview</FONT></B> (with
"recruit hint" setting) - but as said, it's very rare.
<P>
There are basically two possibilities causing this:
<OL>
<LI>Creatures running out (including defender reinforcements)<BR>
If there is one Troll left, and you move 3 legions to a land where you
can get (as "best according to the recruit hint" of course) a Troll,
each of it will display the Troll. But only one of them can get it
later (this case perhaps *could* be fixed).<BR>
Also, according to rules, recruiting happens <B>after</B> all
engagements. This means, if a defender reinforces a Troll in his 4th
battle round, there will - when your recruit phase starts, after all
engagements resolved - be one Troll less in the caretakers stack than
it was during your move phase.

</LI>
<LI>Ongoing engagement blocks a path<BR> Some (not all) recruit hints
depend on "which lands can you reach in next roll". If there is an
engagement somewhere in the possible movement pathes of a legion, the
evalutation "where can this legion move to?" cannot (will not) go
beyond this land where is an engagement. Whether you could go there
(in your next movement turn) will depend on the outcome of that
engagement (and/or the legion moves away by itself); thus, as example,
some Desert does not count as reachable and thus the recruit hint
would not suggest the 3rd Lion, show the Ranger instead.<BR>If you
then win the engagement, your own legion does not block the path to
that Desert thus the Auto-recruit will now take the 3rd Lion.
</OL>

On the long run, the recruit phase later should then at least notify
about this differences, e.g.: "Note: recruit preview for legion
... showed you a Troll but now the autorecruit will take a Ranger" (=
not enough Trolls left) - so that you can review and revise your
recruit decisions, if needed.<BR> Probably there is no way to make
this 100% bulletproof already during move phase - one cannot predict
what will happen during the engagements. (For the 1 Troll left but 3
legions go to a land and get Troll shown as preview there are some
possibilities).

<H2><A NAME="#WindowMenu">Window menu</A></H2>

There are two types/groups of settings here. The first group are all
some additional, smaller ("satellite") windows, showing certain types
of information. Changing the checkboxes make those windows be displayed or
hidden; closing the window with the small cross in right corner will
unmark the checkbox in the menu as well.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#CaretakersStacks">Show Caretaker's stacks</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#GameStatus">Show game status</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#EngagementResults">Show engagement results</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#Inspector">Show inspector</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#EventWindow">Show event window</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#LogWindow">Show log window</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#FullRecruitTree">View Full Recruit Tree</A></LI>
</UL>
The last of them, View Full Recruit Tree, is (technically speaking)
not a checkbox item, but an "action" and can be activated also
by just pressing the "F" key (for "<U>F</U>ull Recruit Tree").
<P>
The remaining options are here because they affect windows "as a
whole": Focus, Scale, Look &amp; Feel and (only sometimes available) "Choose Screen For Info Windows".
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#StealFocus">Steal focus</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#ChangeScale">Change Scale</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#LookFeel">Look &amp; Feel</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#ChooseScreen">Choose Screen For Info Windows</A></LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="#CaretakersStacks">Show Caretaker's stacks</A></H3>

Show or hide the Caretaker's stacks - how many of each creature are available, dead, in use, etc.

<H3><A NAME="#GameStatus">Show game status</A></H3>

Show or hide the game status window. This displays how many legions,
free markers, points, etc. every player has.  
<P>This game status window
also displays also the current game turn number, and, often
overlooked, <B>in a battle you can see here also the current battle
round and phase!</B>

<H3><A NAME="#EngagementResults">Show engagement results</A></H3>

As name says: the results from every engagement. Which legions did
fight, their contents, who won, how (fled, conceded, battle), how many
points earned. There are prev and next buttons to look through all of them.
<P>
There is some special magic builtin to this window - if you press
"Hide" it will disappear and reappear once the next battle finished
you are involved in.  (I think this was meant to be like that, so that
it jumps to the "latest" entry in that window only if you are
involved, and does NOT automatically go to the next one e.g. if the
AI's make quickly several battles. That this has also the effect of
only reappearing in some situations ... well. Someone should take a
look at it...)
<P>
Note that this window only shows the legions as they "were at
engagement start" and the final state of the winner (just the
surviving creatures). I.e. you can't see here what was killed,
summoned, or acquired. Information in that form (what was added or
removed) can be seen from Event Viewer.


<H3><A NAME="#Inspector">Show inspector</A></H3>

A small satellite window always displaying content based on the
current mouse position.  Mostly the content of legions, or on empty
land it shows the recruiting tree of that land.
<P>
You can always look at your own legions. Whether or what you are
entitled to see of other player's legions content depends on the
setting <A HREF="GetPlayersOptions.html#Viewable_legion_content">
<B>Viewable legion content</B> in Get Players selection dialog</A>.

<H3><A NAME="#EventWindow">Show event window</A></H3>

Event Viewer shows all (most of) the events that reveal some
information or are otherwise interesting or relevant.  Mostly this is
needed to follow information which was revealed by recruiting (what
was mustered and and which creatures were "revealed" to proof one is
eligible to do so), teleport, summon, acquire or what survived a
battle.
<P>
Also things like splitting, taking a mulligan, movement roll are shown
there eventhough one would not classify them as "reveal"ing anything.
<P>
A great place to follow what's going on in the game, especially with
many AI players. This Event Viewer is in particularly needed if you
play with "Own legions only" for the setting <A
HREF="GetPlayersOptions.html#Viewable_legion_content">Viewable legion
content</A>.
<P>
Behavior of the Event Viewer (how long back events can be shown) 
depends on the setting <A HREF="GetPlayersOptions.html#EventsExpireAfter">
Events expire after</A>
before game start in the Get Players selection dialog.

<H3><A NAME="#LogWindow">Show log window</A></H3>

A text log window showing lot of details what's going on in the
game. Most of it not relevant for actual playing, but for trouble
shooting. The unfortunate situation is, that text is only added there
when log window is open. Thus if a problem occurs and you display this
window afterwards there is nothing shown. Room for improvement here...

<H3><A NAME="#FullRecruitTree">View Full Recruit Tree</A></H3>

Show a window with all recruit trees (what can be mustered where).
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Okay, here the "affect whole window"-type settings:

<H3><A NAME="#StealFocus">Steal focus</A></H3>

When a different window becomes relevant (as in "here is your action
needed now"), like, summoning during a battle you should select the
donor stack from master board, with this option enabled the
"to-become-active" window might grab the focus by itself (i.e. raise
on top of all other windows), instead of waiting for you to click on
it (or something like that... not sure ;-)

<H3><A NAME="#ChangeScale">Change Scale</A></H3>

Change the scale (zoom factor) of the masterboard and all other
windows.  This is very useful e.g. in Abyssal9, where the masterboard
is much bigger.  Depending on the screen resolution some icons or
texts might then be too small to read them, but always scrolling is
annoying too...


<H3><A NAME="#LookFeel">Look &amp; Feel</A></H3>

This somewhat influences the Look &amp; Feel, i.e. the borders and
text styles of the single windows (e.g. menus). Which "Look &amp; Feel" settings are available to you, might depend on your environment (OS, Java version, Window system); e.g. for me on Windows XP the following choices are offered:
<UL>
<LI>Metal</LI>
<LI>CDE/Motif</LI>
<LI>Windows</LI>
</UL>
No big differences, though... 

<H3><A NAME="#ChooseScreen">Choose Screen For Info Windows</A></H3>

This option is only available if you use a dual screen setup, i.e. two
displays connected to your computer.  <I><B>[is that correct??]</I></B>
<P>
Then you can use this setting to choose a different screen for the satellite
windows.

<H2><A NAME="#HelpMenu">Help menu</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="#HelpAbout">Help - About</A></H3>

Tells some basic information about your running Colossus application.
Shown are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Colossus build:</B> The build version/date of the used jar files. Important information in bug reports.</LI>

<LI><B>user.home:</B> Which directory Colossus considers to be your
home directory. Under that directory will be (created if necessary) a
directory ".colossus". In this .colossus directory the saved user
settings (as "Colossus-&lt;playername&gt;.cfg") and the server
settings (global, i.e. server side game options, which are selected in
the Get Players startup dialog, as "Colossus-server.cfg" - of course
only if you run the server); saved games are stored in a subdirectory
"saves" under this .colossus directory.</LI>

<LI><B>java.version:</B> Which java version you are using to run this
game. This also is a very important information when making bug
reports.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="#VariantReadme">Help - Show Variant Readme</A></H3>

This shows the same Variant Readme file that is also displayed in 
the Variant Readme pane during the Get Players startup selection.
<P>
This Readme describes the variant you are currently playing; like, in
which aspects it differs from the "Default" variant ( = standard Titan
as the original Avalon Hill game); often, it lists up information
like when/how angels (or other summonables in some variants) can be
acquired, and which creatures can be recruited where in an easier to
read form than clicking the recruit trees of the individual lands; often 
some credits, who invented that variant, and so on.

<H3><A NAME="#OptionsDocumentation">Help - Options Documentation</A></H3>

The purpose of this is to provide help/documentation for the client side
options (MasterBoard menu) and server side options (Get Players dialog).
<P>
Right now it simply displays in a text area links (URLs) to the
relevant web pages on the Colossus home page. This might or should 
eventually be developed further to become a proper help page browsing
system...
<P>
<HR>

<I>
Created July 2007, reflecting the state of Colossus at this time (directly after rearrangement of the MasterBoard menus).
