<h1>Settings in Get Players startup dialog</h1>
This document is a start to describe the available settings in the 
Colossus startup dialog (like player selection, which variant, and so on)
and their meaning. Some descriptions are not too detailed yet.
<p>
The top part of the startup dialog consists of a tabbed pane with 3 panes: 
<b>Players</b>, <b>Options</b> and <b>Variant README</b>.
<P>
In the bottom are controls for Variant selection and Game startup, 
always visible no matter which pane is selected.

<hr>
<h2>Players pane (player selection, variant selection, and action buttons)</h2>

Here you can select the number of players by setting that number of
player types to a type (different than "none"): human player on same
host, network player (human player on some remote host), or a number
of "AI" types, i.e. robot players.
<P>
Fill in the wanted number and types of players, leave the remaining one as
<b>none</b>. For human (local) players give a name; remote players should
be left to their default <b>&lt;By client&gt;</b>, and for AI players it 
is usually useful to leave the setting to <b>&lt;By color&gt;</b>.
<P>
With Colossus on can play Titan (the original board, creatures, etc.) as
well as a number of variants - modified board or creatures
(different/additional ones, their skills and abilities modified, different
recruiting possibilities, and so on).
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Options pane (various settings for the game)</h2>

<h3>Section "General"</h3>
Those are hopefully self-explaining:
<ul>
<li>Autosave
<li>Log debug messages
<li>Balanced starting towers
<li>AIs stop when humans dead
<li>Auto quit when game over
</ul>

<h3>Section "Viewability of legions and events"</h3>

This controls whether one is
allowed to view the contents of other players legions, and how long
the events which reveal such information are visible before they
vanish.
<p>
<b>Viewable legion content:</b><P>
That is a popup menu box with three possible selections:
<ul>
<li>Only own legions
<li>Ever revealed (or concludable) since start
<li>True content for all legions
</ul>
This setting controls which or how much information is shown to you when
you look into legions using right-click or the Inspector window (those of other players - for your own ones you see
always the full true content).
<p>
The first one is like standard Titan - you are only allowed to review the
contents of your own legions; information what is in other players legions
you can only know based on events where such information is publicly revealed 
(e.g. recruiting, teleport), and you must memorize and conclude all by yourself.
<p>
The last one is simple - you can simply look into every legion, be it
yours or that of any other player.  <p>The middle one, "Ever revealed
..." is more complex. Colossus has a feature called split-prediction;
it keeps track of such revealed information, and automatically draws
conclusions ("if the angel is here, then the Titan must be in that
legion because it is the only other uncertain one right now"). If this option is selected, you see the result of such automatic tracking and conclusions,
i.e. the same what the AI's will know.
<p>
This view shows you for other players legions all creatures which can with
has ever been shown or can with certainty be concluded that a certain creature
is in a certain legion.
<P>
For the remaining creatures in the legion, the Split prediction has a
"best guess" - like, parent before a split had Titan, some weak and
some strong creatures, and Titan teleported and is known, the rest
not; most likely the strong creatures are with the titan and the weak
ones in the split-off - but that is not certain.  For those which are
uncertain (if and only if this view mode is selected), every client (=
every individual player) has in his Graphics menu (in the running game
then) a option called "<B>Uncertain as blank</B>" which controls,
whether for this uncertain ones shall be displayed the best guess
(with a question mark over it) or rather nothing (just a question
mark).
<P>
<b>Events expire after (turns):</b><P> That is a popup menu box with
numeric values. The selected value specifies for how (at maximum) 
long back the
events are viewable in the players "EventViewer" window (also from
Graphics menu).  This EventViewer windows "reveals" all those events
that would in an actual board game be mandatory to be revealed to
other players - like: splitting, recruiting (what creature was taken,
and what does he have that allows him to do so), teleport, acquired
and summoned angels, and battle results (Note: the latter one are not
fully implemended in the EventViewer, but there is a separate
"Engagement Results" window). 
<P>
In the EventViewer itself a player can select to display (beside which 
types of events) fewer than the number of turns set in "Events expire after
(turns)" setting, but not more than those.


<h3>Section "Teleport"</h3><p>
Those are hopefully self-explaining - the named teleport types are or are not 
allowed.
<ul>
<li>No tower-to-tower teleport on first turn
<li>No teleport on first turn
<li>No Titan teleport
<li>Tower-to-Tower teleport only
<li>No Tower teleport
</ul>

<h3>Section "Rules"</h3><p>

<ul>
<li>Slowing is cumulative
<li>Always allow one hex
<li>Use non-random battle dice
</ul>
See questions <B>What's the option "Slowing is cumulative"</B> and <b>
What's the option Always allows one hex?</b> in the <A HREF="FAQ.html">FAQ</A>.
<P>
The last one would use always a predefined sequence of rolls for battle 
dice rolling. Probably only relevant for debugging purposes.

<h3>Section "AI timing"</h3><p>
Those values control how long an AI will pause after certain actions and how
long time it may maximum take for certain steps (calculating what is the best move and so on).
<hr>
<h2>Variant README pane</h2>

In the <b>Players</b> pane you can choose from a number of Variants, for
which in this <b>Variant README</b> pane is then a description shown that
tells what is different in this variant comparing to the standard Titan.

<hr>
<h2>Bottom area</h2>

In the <B>Variant</B> section under the tabbed pane you can select which
variant to play. There are several variants built-in, or alternatively 
you could load an external variant from local files on your
computer. By default preselected variant is called <b>Default</b>
which is corresponding to the original Titan board and creatures.

<P>
In the bottom (<b>Game Startup</B>) section are action buttons to start
the game, load a previously saved game, run a network client (see <A
HREF="network.html">Networked Colossus</A> for details), or Quit.
