<h1>Colossus - Get Players startup dialog</h1>
<H3>Scope</h3>
This document is a start to describe the available settings and options in 
the Colossus startup dialog (like player selection, which variant, and so on)
and their meaning. 
<P>
They are selected on server side by the player hosting the game (=being the
"game server") during the Player Selection / Game setup, affect the
game globally and cannot be changed any more once the game has
started.
<p>
For the client-local options that individual players can each 
change on their own individually see the
<A HREF="ClientOptions.html">Client options</A> page.
<P>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The top part of the startup dialog consists of a tabbed pane with 3
panes: 
<A HREF="#PlayerSelection"><b>Players</b></A>, 
<A HREF="#ServersideOptions"><b>Options</b></A> and 
<A HREF="#VariantReadmePane"><b>Variant README</b></A>.
<P>
In the <A HREF="#GetPlayerBottomPart">bottom part</A> are controls for Variant selection and Game startup, 
always visible no matter which pane is selected.
<P>
<hr>
<h2><A NAME="#PlayerSelection">Player Selection pane</A></h2>

Here you can select the number of players by setting that number of
player types to a type (different than "none"): human player on same
host, network player (human player on some remote host), or a number
of "AI" types, i.e. robot players.
<P>
For the numbers of players wanted, set the player type appropriately, 
and leave (or set so if needed) the remaining one as <b>none</b>. 
For human (local) players give a name; remote players should
be left to their default <b>&lt;By client&gt;</b>, and for AI players it 
is usually the best to leave the setting to <b>&lt;By color&gt;</b>.
<P>
<hr>
<h2><A NAME="#ServersideOptions">Options pane (various settings for the game)</A></h2>

<h3>Section "General"</h3>
Those are hopefully self-explaining:
<ul>
<li><A NAME="#Autosave">Autosave</A>
<li>Log debug messages
<li>Balanced starting towers
<li>AIs stop when humans dead
<li>Auto quit when game over
</ul>

<h3>Section "Viewability of legions and events"</h3>

This controls whether one is allowed to view the contents of other
players legions, and how long the events which reveal such information
are visible before they vanish.
<p>
<b><A NAME="#Viewable_legion_content">Viewable legion content:</A></b><P>
That is a popup menu box with three possible selections:
<ul>
<li>Only own legions
<li>Ever revealed (or concludable) since start
<li>True content for all legions
</ul>
This setting controls which or how much information is shown to you
when you look into legions using right-click on a legion or the
<A HREF="ClientOptions.html#Inspector">Inspector window</A> (those of
 other players - for your own ones you see always the full true content).
<p>
The first one is like standard Titan - you are only allowed to review the
contents of your own legions; information what is in other players legions
you can only know based on events where such information is publicly revealed 
(e.g. recruiting, teleport), and you must memorize and conclude all by yourself.
<p>
The last one is simple - you can simply look into every legion, be it
yours or that of any other player.  <p>The middle one, "Ever revealed
..." is more complex. Colossus has a feature called split-prediction;
it keeps track of such revealed information, and automatically draws
conclusions ("if the angel is here, then the Titan must be in that
legion because it is the only other uncertain one right now"). If this option is selected, you see the result of such automatic tracking and conclusions,
i.e. the same what the AI's will know.
<p>
This view shows you for other players legions all creatures which were ever
revealed, or can with certainty be concluded that a certain creature
is in a certain legion.
<P>
For the remaining creatures in the legion, the Split prediction has a
"best guess" - like, parent before a split had Titan, some weak and
some strong creatures, and Titan teleported and is known, the rest
not; most likely the strong creatures are with the titan and the weak
ones in the split-off - but that is not certain.  
<P>
For those which are uncertain (if and only if this view mode is
selected), every client (= every individual player) has in his
Graphics menu (in the running game then) a option called <A
HREF="ClientOptions.html#UncertainAsBlank"> Uncertain as blank</A>
which controls, whether for this uncertain ones shall be displayed the
best guess (with a question mark over it) or rather nothing (just a
question mark).
<P>
<b><A NAME="EventsExpireAfter">Events expire after</A> (turns):</b>
<P> 
That is a popup menu box with numeric values. The selected value
specifies for how (at maximum) long back the events are viewable in
the players "EventViewer" window (now in "Window" menu).  This
EventViewer windows "reveals" all those events that would in an actual
board game be mandatory to be revealed to other players - like:
splitting, recruiting (what creature was taken, and what does he have
that allows him to do so), teleport, acquired and summoned angels, and
battle results (Note: the latter one are not fully implemended in the
EventViewer, but there is a separate "Engagement Results" window).
<P>
In the EventViewer itself a player can select to display (beside which 
types of events) fewer than the number of turns set in "Events expire after
(turns)" setting, but not more than those.


<h3>Section "Teleport"</h3><p>
Those are hopefully self-explaining - the named teleport types are or are not 
allowed.
<ul>
<li>No tower-to-tower teleport on first turn
<li>No teleport on first turn
<li>No Titan teleport
<li>Tower-to-Tower teleport only
<li>No Tower teleport
</ul>

<h3>Section "Rules"</h3><p>

<ul>
<li>Slowing is cumulative
<li>Always allow one hex
<li>Use non-random battle dice
</ul>

<B><A NAME="#SlowingCumulative">Slowing is cumulative:</A></B>
<P>
In regular Titan, there&#39;s never two slowing reasons together (you
don&#39;t find a bramble up a slope, for instance). In Variants this is
possible, so we must decide what to do: do you need 2 (only one slow) or
3 (count them both) movement points to go to an up-slope bramble
(assuming you&#39;re non-native) ? Without this option, 2. With this
option, 3. We don&#39;t decide, you do :-)</p>
<P>
<B><A NAME="#AlwaysAllowOneHex">Always allow one hex:</A></B>
<P>
This is necessary after introducing the aforementioned option
<b>Slowing is cumulative</b>. What if a 2-skill creature wants to
enter an up-slope bramble?  Without this option, it's impossible.
With this option, any creature can enter any non-impassible hex as its
first move (it will only move one hex), so our 2-skill creature can
enter our up-slope bramble if it hasn't moved yet.
<p>
<B><A NAME="#NonRandomBattleDice">Use non-random battle dice:</A></B>
this would use always a predefined sequence of rolls (right now:
4,3,1,6,5,2) for battle dice rolling instead of random numbers. This
would not necessarily guarantee "more equal chances" to the players,
as it might still be that the one gets e.g. 6, 5, 2, 4, next player
rangestrikes (only 2) gets 3 and 1, first player again the high
numbers etc. Probably only relevant for debugging purposes.

<h3>Section "AI timing"</h3><p>
Those values control how long an AI will pause after certain actions and how
long time it may maximum take for certain steps (calculating what is the best move and so on).
<hr>
<h2><A NAME="#VariantReadmePane">Variant README pane</A></h2>

With Colossus one can play "Standard Titan" (the original board,
creatures, etc.) as well as a number of variants - modified board and/or
creatures (different/additional ones, their skills and abilities
modified, different recruiting possibilities, and so on).
<p>
In the bottom of the Get Players dialog you can choose from a number
of Variants, for which in this <b>Variant README</b> pane is then a
description shown that tells what is different in this variant
comparing to the standard Titan.

<hr>
<h2><A NAME="#GetPlayerBottomPart">Bottom part</A></h2>

<H3>Variant selection</H3>
In the <B>Variant</B> section below the tabbed pane you can select
from the pulldown-menu which variant to play.  There are several
variants built-in, or alternatively you could load an external variant
from local files on your computer [perhaps not working properly right
now?] using the <B>Load External Variant</B> button on the right side. 
See <A HREF="Variant-HOWTO.html">Variant-HOWTO</A> for details.
<P>
By default preselected variant is called <b>Default</b> which
is corresponding to the original Titan masterboard and creatures.
<H3>Game starting</H3>
In the bottom-most (<b>Game Startup</B>) section are action buttons to start
the game, load a previously saved game, run a network client (see <A
HREF="network.html">Networked Colossus</A> for details), or Quit.
