<h1>Release Note for Colossus 0.10.3</h1>
<p/>
Usability and stability improvements: 
<ul>
<li>A simple /ping command to notify another player (e.g. he has forgotten to click Done).</li>
<li>Only game creator can start the game. If he is not enrolled, the first player from
    enrolled list instead.</li>
<li>Arranged GUI items in CreateGame tab more compactly, so that Start button 
    is (hopefully) visible on 1024x768 screens.</li>
<li>Added info text in Hazard chart window that mouse over a symbol will give 
    explanatory popup text.</li>
<li>Admin stuff: Possibility to display some message to everyone when he logs in.</li> 
<li>When right clicking on a masterboard land with legions (but not 
    clicked a legion itself), popup menu now offers also "Show legion(s)" action.</li>
<li>Added as option: show the legion marker in autoinspector, 
    rightclick-shows-legion and shift/ctrl popups</li>    
<li>Concede/Flee dialog tells "this will give XXX points to ..., 
    raising the score from xxx to yyy". And some layout improvements.</li>
<li>In Flee/Concede dialog, disable that Space activates the selected button.
    Note that Return key activates the "default" action of that dialog, 
    which is Show Battle Map (which does not harm)</li>
<li>In Flee/Concede dialog, mark the to-be-killed (= own) legion all as dead.</li>
<li>In Flee/Concede dialog, added button for Show Battle Map, 
    and text says from which side attacker enters.</li>
<li>Lot of fixes related to game starting failing</li>
<li>Prevent enrolling to a game that is already starting.</li>
<li>Prevent on server side the starting of a game where not all enrolled players
    are logged in.</li>
<li>On WebClient side, for check if game could be started, check also for instant 
    games that all enrolled players are online.</li>
<li>Directly after game start was triggered (state set to ACTIVATED), update 
    GameInfo to _all_ logged-in users (not only enrolled ones), so that they see 
    there is no point to enroll any more.</li>
<li>Added a "wishlist and TODO" doc related to Public Game Server</li>
<li>Improved the popup message which informs that the _WebClient_ connection
    was closed from server side, game is not affected.</li>
<li>Some keep-line-alive functionality between WebServer and WebClient</li>
<li>Some very simple keep-alive functionality also between "real" game server 
    and client (i.e. actual game, not the WebClient connection)</li>            
    
</ul>
