This file document file formats for the various datafile used
by Colossus.

1) MAP file format (default file used: StrategicMap.map)

This file define the Colossus Masterboard ; what terrain type to use
for an hex and what sort of exit to which hex. It's composed
of a succession of line:

CASE <case_label> <case_type>
 <exit_1_label> <exit_1_type>
 <exit_2_label> <exit_2_type>
 <exit_3_label> <exit_3_type>
 <X_pos> <Y_pos>

All of those should be on one line.

CASE is the literal word CASE.

<case_label> is the numeric label of the Hex.
<case_type> is the terrain type of the hex (PLAINS, HILLS, ...)
<exit_N_label> are numeric labels for exits 1-3,
 or 0 for no (second, third) exit
<exit_N_type> is the type of exits (ARROW, ARROWS, ARCH, BLOCK) ;
 for exit of label '0' (no exit) any of the four value can be
 used, as exit type is irrelevant.
<X_pos> and <Y_pos> is the position X,Y of the Hex on the
 masterboard. They both start from 'one', on the first line
 and first column. all lines are different (i.e. on the default
 master board, case 126 and 125 are on two different lines,
respectively 2 and one, and on columns 4 and 5).

At the moment, max size is the same as the default master board.

2) TER file format (default file used: Recruit.ter)

This file define the Colossus Recruit Trees ; what
can recruit and be recruited on what terrain. it's composed
of a succession of line:

<terrain_letter> <terrain_name> (<recruiter_needed> <recruit>)+

<terrain_letter> is the letter internaly used to identify the terrain.
 they must all be different.

<terrain_name> is the descriptive name of the terrain (Brush, ...)

<recruiter_needed> is the number of lower-rank creature needed
 to recruit the next creature.

<recruit> is the name of the recruit creature (Gargoyle, ...)

the last two as a pair can be repeated any number of time. The first pair
ignore the <recruiter_needed> number, so it should be '1'.
Any later creature can recruit a previous one or itself.
A creature can recruit the next one only if they are numerous
enough, as indicated by the <recruiter_needed> _of the recruit_.

the line that starts with 'T Tower' (mandatory) is different.
It should contain 5 pairs, all with '1' as the <recruiter_needed>
except for the next-to-last that should be '3'. First three
are 'anything  can recruit' creature, 4the fourth is 'anything
numerous enough can recruit', the fifth and last is 'Titan can
recruit'.

Note: for the guardian or the guardian replacement, any value
othe than '3' will _not_ work.
