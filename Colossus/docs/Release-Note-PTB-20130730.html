<h1>July 30, 2013: Public Test Build from r5317</h1>
<p/>
<b>Note: </b>this public test build probably still contains the bugs that some users reported,
             that game got stuck when they conceded twice in same battle turn, and that if 
             some players use this test build, it may cause for other players using the "regular" 
             release (0.13.2.1 at the moment) a crash when the battle is about to 
             start (BattleBoard is not coming up).

<p />
Some usability improvements, added /userinfo command, more stability improvements to spectator mode.
