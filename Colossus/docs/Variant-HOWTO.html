    <h4>How do I use a Variant Pack ?</h4>
    Just use the 
    <b>Load External Variant</b>
    button and open the 
    XML-based <b>VAR</b>
    file inside the variant directory, then start a new game. That should be
    enough. Alternatively, many variants are now supplied in the standard
    distribution ; simply use the pop-up menu to select which variant to play (
    <b>Default</b>
    is the Classic Titan ruleset). 
    <h4>What&#39;s in a Variant Pack ?</h4>
    A Variant Pack should be a directory (folder) containing: 
    <ul>
        <li>A mandatory
        XML-based <b>VAR</b>
        file, that describes the other files</li>
        <li> Optionals
        XML-based <b>CRE</b>
        , 
        XML-based <b>TER</b>
        and 
        XML-based <b>MAP</b>
        files that describe the variant</li>
        <li>An optional
        <b>Battlelands</b>
        subdirectory that contains the new and/or changed Battlelands</li>
        <li>An optional
        <b>images</b>
        subdirectory that contains the new and/or changed pictures.</li>
        <li>A mandatory
        <b>Hint</b>
        Java source file that helps the AI play your variant.  This is 
        <b>required</b> if you have non-standard Tower numbers.  (If you 
        don't know Java, ask for help on the colossus-developers list.)
    </ul>
    The various files are either XML-based or Java code, and at the moment there
    is no proper description of the formats. Sorry.
    <h4>How do I create a Variant Pack ?</h4>
    There&#39;s no user-friendly way yet. The easiest way is to build the
    directory and copy the default files in it, then you can change them with
    any text editor.

    You can also use other variants as examples. Warning: almost no sanity
    checks are performed, and some combinations might give strange and/or
    unexpected results, particurly in Battlelands (slope next to a tree, or
    cliff between two bogs...). Also, ensuring consistency between the files is
    up to the variant author. Battlelands can also be created using the
    graphical tool 
    <b>BattlelandsBuilder</b>
    . There may be an easier (read: graphical) way later for 
    <b>CRE</b>
    , 
    <b>TER</b>
    and 
    <b>MAP</b>
    files, but don&#39;t hold your breath, as nobody is working on it yet.
