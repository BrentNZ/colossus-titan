    <h2>The Variant Pack</h2>
    <h4>How do I use a Variant Pack ?</h4>
    Just use the 
    <b>Load External Variant</b>
    button and open the 
    <b>VAR</b>
    file inside the variant directory, then start a new game. That should be
    enough. Alternatively, some variants are now supplied in the standard
    distribution ; simply use the pop-up menu to select which variant to play (
    
    <b>Default</b>
    is the Classic Titan ruleset). 
    <h4>What&#39;s in a Variant Pack ?</h4>
    A Variant Pack should be a directory (folder) containing: 
    <ul>
        <li>A 
        <b>VAR</b>
        file, that describes the other files</li>
        <li>
        <b>CRE</b>
        , 
        <b>TER</b>
        and 
        <b>MAP</b>
        files that describe the variant</li>
        <li>A 
        <b>Battlelands</b>
        subdirectory that contains the new and/or changed Battlelands</li>
        <li>An 
        <b>images</b>
        subidirectory that contains the new and/or changed pictures.</li>
    </ul>
    The various files are described in details inside the 
    <a
     href="FileFormats.html">file formats document</a>
    . 
    <h4>How do I create a Variant Pack ?</h4>
    There&#39;s no user-friendly way yet. The easiest way is to build the
    directory and copy the default files in it, then you can change them with
    any text editor. The contents of the files are described in the 
    <a
     href="FileFormats.html">file formats document</a>
    . You can also use other variants as examples. Warning: almost no sanity
    checks are performed, and some combinations might give strange and/or
    unexpected results, particurly in Battlelands (slope next to a tree, or
    cliff between two bogs...). Also, ensuring consistency between the files is
    up to the variant author. Battlelands can also be created using the
    graphical tool 
    <b>BattlelandsBuilder</b>
    . There may be an easier (read: graphical) way later for 
    <b>CRE</b>
    , 
    <b>TER</b>
    and 
    <b>MAP</b>
    files, but don&#39;t hold your breath, as nobody is working on it yet. 
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My creature won&#39;t load, or my creature is displayed as a dull
        grey square 
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>The creature&#39;s name (the first column of a 
        <b>CRE</b>
        file) should not contain spaces or other non-alphabetical characters
        (you can&#39;t use digits yet), unless put between doublequotes
        (&quot;). i.e. proper names are 
        <b>&quot;KillerRabbitTwo&quot;</b>
        or 
        <b>&quot;Killer Rabbit 2&quot;</b>
        . The same name must be used in the 
        <b>CRE</b>
        and 
        <b>TER</b>
        files. The creature&#39;s name is also used as the base name of the
        pictures. So a 
        <b>KillerRabbitTwo</b>
        will use the file 
        <b>KillerRabbitTwo.gif</b>
        in the subdirectory 
        <b>images</b>
        . Spaces will be replaced by underscores (_), and double quotes will be
        ignored. So 
        <b>&quot;Killer Rabbit 2&quot;</b>
        will use 
        <b>Killer_Rabbit_2.gif</b>
        . You should be able to re-use an existing name, as the 
        <b>images</b>
        subdirectory is accessed before the default GIF files.</p>
