    <title>Colossus: Release Note for Colossus 0.14.0</title>
</head>
<body>


<h1>September 17, 2013: Release 0.14.0 from r5331</h1>

<p/>
<b>Note: </b>This new release probably still contains the bugs that some users reported,
             that game got stuck when they conceded twice in same battle turn, and that if 
             some players use this new build, it may cause for other players using the 
             previous release (0.13.2.1) a crash when the battle is about to 
             start (BattleBoard is not coming up). One way around that is, 
             that all start using this new release :-)
<p />
