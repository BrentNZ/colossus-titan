<h1>Release Note for Colossus 0.12.0</h1>
<p/>
A new variant, some new features, and the usual amount of fixes and
changes which hopefully improve stability.
<ul>
<li>Fixed: 3176758 "null pointer exception" - happened in particularly when
    aborting a teleport move by closing PickEntrySide dialog, and even
    permanent problems together with "pendingMoves" stuff feature 
    (see next line, 3160858).</li>
<li>Fixed: 3160858 "Move failed messages due to delayed server response".
    Visual feedback (clicked target hex highlighted red) and client prevents
    attempt to move an already-moved (just display update delayed case) legion 
    once more.</li>
<li>Fixed: 3160863 "illegal call to engage() message due to slow server response". 
    Client prevents now clicking same (or any other legion/hex) for engaging when just 
    clicked one (and just no feedback yet due to delayed server response).</li>
<li>"First-aid" correction to: 3160873 "Concede hangs game" and 3133960 "Conceding battle 
    leads to hung game": Now also inactive players concede directly ends the battle.
    This is not in in line with official rules, but all-in-all I consider this the better
    solution, if the alternative is having games hung regularly; implementing this in
    proper way (to be compliant with rules <b>and</b> have no risk of hung games) is simply
    out of reach by now. Created a feature request to "implement proper concede sequence 
    in safe way".</li>        
<li>Minor changes to DinoTitan variant (some creature power/skill values, Spinosaur added, 
    some battle lands, 2 needed in top of recruitment line in Springs, README file).</li>    
</ul>
<i>The changes below were already part of "Public Testing Release" 0.12.0-beta1:</i>
<ul>
<li>A new variant "DinoTitan" added. The creator is looking forward to get
    feedback about it!</li>
<li>Added an option to disable Warlock recruiting on the first turn.</li>
<li>Fixed: 3033654 Battleboard Window (does not remember location nor size).</li>
<li>Fixed: 2884952 GetPlayers: disabled player names.</li>
<li>Some improvements in confirmation code per comments from developer's 
    group, addition of a visited flag to legions so that move confirmation
    is more selective and usable, addition of a next key ('n') for the move, 
    muster and split phases to move to the next legion that requires action.</li>
<li>When using the N key to move to the next legion to act on, 
    highlight the hex of that legion as well as placing the mouse over it.</li>
<li>Fix for BattleTerrain/Hazards display feature. Fix existing specials 
    (e.g. Drift) and add new ones for DinoTitan</li>    
<li>When a game is proposed, send a systemMessage announcing it.</li>
<li>Better error handling for game starting: 
    Added a generic "system message" method. Informs now for example about
    which player did connect ok to starting game, and if failed, report the
    summary which players connected successfully and which not.</li>
<li>Synchronize (with value false) the global options that are not defined 
    (e.g. teleport settings) from server to client to override possibly 
    existing settings in client side config files.</li>
<li>Added a RoundtripTimeBookKeeper for Webserver => WebClientC => WebServer 
    pingRequests/Responses.</li>
<li>WebServer Client handler has now own writer thread which is fed via 
    a concurrent queue. Thus delays in writing to one client should not cause
    other clients to hang any more.</li>
</ul>
