<h1>Release Note for Colossus 0.12.0 (-beta1)</h1>
<p/>
A new variant, some new features, and the usual amount of fixes and
changes which hopefully improve network stability.
<ul>
<li>A new variant "DinoTitan" added. The creator is looking forward to get
    feedback about it!</li>
<li>Added an option to disable Warlock recruiting on the first turn.</li>
<li>Fixed: 3033654 Battleboard Window (does not remember location nor size).</li>
<li>Fixed: 2884952 GetPlayers: disabled player names</li>
<li>Some improvements in confirmation code per comments from developer's 
    group, addition of a visited flag to legions so that move confirmation
    is more selective and usable, addition of a next key ('n') for the move, 
    muster and split phases to move to the next legion that requires action.</li>
<li>When using the N key to move to the next legion to act on, 
    highlight the hex of that legion as well as placing the mouse over it.</li>
<li>Fix for BattleTerrain/Hazards display feature. Fix existing specials 
    (e.g. Drift) and add new ones for DinoTitan</li>    
<li>When a game is proposed, send a systemMessage announcing it.</li>
<li>Better error handling for game starting: 
    Added a generic "system message" method. Informs now for example about
    which player did connect ok to starting game, and if failed, report the
    summary which players connected successfully and which not.</li>
<li>Synchronize (with value false) the global options that are not defined 
    (e.g. teleport settings) from server to client to override possibly 
    existing settings in client side config files.</li>
<li>Added a RoundtripTimeBookKeeper for Webserver => WebClientC => WebServer 
    pingRequests/Responses.</li>
<li>WebServer Client handler has now own writer thread which is fed via 
    a concurrent queue. Thus delays in writing to one client should not cause
    other clients to hang any more.</li>
</ul>
