    <title>Colossus: Release Note for 0.13.1</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>March 11, 2012: Release 0.13.1 from r5121</h1>
<p/>
Further work on reconnect functionality and other improvements.<br>

<i>(almost all of it was already in effect in the Public Test Builds)</i> 
<ul>

<li>Fixed 3497085: Undo battle move errors</li>
<li>Implemented FR 3494746: Show board for AI-only games also (when GUI-started)</li>
<li>When user clicked Start Game, give visual feedback and disable cancel+unenroll to everybody</li>
<li>As soon as game is activated, disable Enroll button for other players</li>
<li>In StartGame, ignore case if passed-with user name has case difference compared to "official" user's name.</li>
<li>In remote client, if game is already over, do not ask the "do you really want to concede" 
    when one attempts to close the battle window</li>
<li>Prevent/Handle accidental duplicate battle moves better (or: the delay between click and
    actual server feedback, added visual feedback)</li>
<li>Finetuning with the "delayed withdraw": if client did not reconnect within approx. 3 minutes withdraw him. 
    Inform other clients (if they are new enough to  handle such information) about situation</li>
<li>If updatePlayerInfo would re-send identical info as last time, skip it (reduces network traffic)</li>
<li>Prevent the registration of user names guest* and anonym*</li>
<li>Implemented FR 3494746: Show board for AI-only games also (when GUI-started)</li>
<li>ConnectionLogWindow now show &amp; hide to work as expected and keep checkbox in sync</li>
<li>Skip withdraw / "withdraw if didn't reconnect in time" processing if player already 
    dead (or client not a player anyway, e.g. in future spectator clients)</li>
<li>By default, now stop accepting clients again after game start is completed/all clients have connected. 
    If configured in Colossus-server.cfg, keep accepting (and WebServer starting games sets this to true);
    (intermediately, to allow reconnect, server socket kept accepting always, which can cause trouble
    when playing locally several games after each other, and previous one keeps hogging the socket)</li>
</ul>
