    <title>Frequently Asked Questions for Colossus</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>Why does the game sometimes prompt me twice for recruits? 
      <p>Look closer. It&#39;s asking for the recruit and then for the
      recruiter(s). Do you want to recruit that cyclops with your other
      cyclops, or with your two gargoyles? If like most people you don&#39;t
      care, then turn on 
      <b>Auto pick recruiters</b>
       and the computer will just pick one for you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Why is the angel X&#39;d out in the summon dialog? I have one. 
      <p>Because you haven&#39;t selected the donor stack with the angel. When
      the Summon Angel dialog pops up, all of your unengaged legions with
      summonable creatures will be highlighted. Pick one, then click on the
      Summon button.</p>
      </li>
      <li>How come I can see enemy units, but some have question marks over
      them? 
      <p>This is a demonstration of the AI&#39;s stack prediction algorithm.
      Using memory of creatures that it&#39;s seen, process of elimination, and
      some guesses about reasonable splits, it tries to figure out what&#39;s
      in enemy stacks. We&#39;ll add the ability to turn this off later, for
      those who want the extra challenge of doing it yourself.</p>
      </li>
      <li>How to I make a legion spin around in a circle back to the original
      hex when I roll a 6? 
      <p>Just click on the chit twice.</p>
      </li>
      <li>What does the Antialias option do? 
      <p>It makes the graphics a bit smoother (look closely at the hexside
      edges while you turn it on and off), but this takes some CPU cycles. I
      recommend turning it on if you have a fast computer and leaving it off if
      you have a slow computer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Why is the AI so dumb? 
      <p>Titan has a huge branching complexity. So brute force searching
      through all possible moves several turns ahead isn&#39;t possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>What&#39;s the difference between 
      <b>SimpleAI</b>
       and 
      <b>CowardSimpleAI</b>
       and 
      <b>A Random AI</b>
       ? 
      <p>SimpleAI does a straightforward one-ply lookahead for MasterBoard
      moves. It works fairly well. CowardSimpleAI is the same code with some
      constants changed to make it less aggressive. A Random AI just chooses
      one of the available AIs at random -- this will be a more interesting
      option when there are more viable alternatives.</p>
      </li>
      <li>What does the 
      <b>Load External Variant</b>
       button do? 
      <p>It lets you load a variant that&#39;s somewhere else in the
      filesystem, not included in the game&#39;s jar file.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Why, in the Caretaker&#39;s Stack, do some creatures have 
      <b>--</b>
       instead of a number ? Why, in the Caretaker&#39;s Stack, are some
      creatures not red-crossed when there are 0 left? 
      <p>Same reason: those creatures are &quot;immortal&quot;, i.e. when
      they&#39;re killed on the batllefields, they&#39;re put back in the
      Caretaker&#39;s Stack and not in the Graveyard (for instance, in
      traditional Titan, they&#39;re Angel, Archangel, Warlock, Guardian and
      Titan).</p>
      </li>
      <li>What&#39;s the option "Slowing is cumulative" ? 
      <p>In regular Titan, there&#39;s never two slowing reasons together (you
      don&#39;t find a bramble up a slope, for instance). In Variants this is
      possible, so we must decide what to do: do you need 2 (only one slow) or
      3 (count them both) movement points to go to an up-slope bramble
      (assuming you&#39;re non-native) ? Without this option, 2. With this
      option, 3. We don&#39;t decide, you do :-)</p>
      </li>
      <li>What&#39;s the option 
      <b>Always allows one hex</b>
       ? 
      <p>This is necessary after introducing the aforementioned option 
      <b>Slowing is cumulative</b>
       . What if a 2-skill creature wants to enter an up-slope bramble ?
      Without this option, it&#39;s impossible. With this option, any creature
      can enter any non-impassible hex as its first move (it will only move one
      hex), so our 2-skill creature can enter our up-slope bramble if it
      hasn&#39;t moved yet.</p>
      </li>
      <li>How can I help? 
      <p>Bug reports are great. Detailed bug reports delivered via the
      SourceForge bug tracker are even better. If you want to contribute code,
      make sure that you&#39;re starting from the latest source (so pull from
      CVS). Please read and follow the coding standards so your code is easier
      to merge. Join and send mail to the dev mailing list at SF so we know
      what you&#39;re up to. Beyond that, just code whatever you want and send
      patches when it works.</p>
