\section{Networked Colossus}

Colossus is now playable over a TCP/IP network.  However, the network 
functionality is still new and probably buggy.  And turn-based games
are inherently brittle -- if one player stops moving or drops his 
connection, then the game is ruined for everybody.  (For now -- we'll
add the ability to reconnect or have an AI take over later.)  So I
recommend starting with 2-player games rather than 6-player games.

One person needs to run the server.  For now, Colossus servers are 
short-lived, staying up only for the length of one game.  The server
needs a local copy of the Colossus code, and a Java Development Kit 
or Java Runtime Environment.  The JDK/JRE bin directory needs to be 
in the PATH.  And the server computer needs to have a well-known 
hostname or IP address accessible to the other players' computers, 
without draconian firewalling.

The server operator simply runs the normal "run" script used to run 
hotseat games.  The startup dialog should appear as normal, allowing 
you to set the variant, optional rules, and how many players of which 
types you want.  Human players are local to the server machine.  
Network players are remote.  The game will wait for *exactly* the 
number of network players you specify, then start the game.  If you 
prefer, you can use command-line options instead.  ``\texttt{run -h}'' 
to see them.

Each client needs to wait for the server to be started, then run
the runclient script.  It takes two arguments.  -p playername and
-s server host name.  The player name will default to your OS user
name if you don't specify one.  The server host will default to the
local machine, which probably isn't what you want unless you're doing
loopback testing.  So you'll want to run it like
``\texttt{runclient -s hostname}''
You can use the IP address instead of the hostname if you prefer.

Once all the clients have connected, then the game should start up like
a normal Colossus game.  When the game ends, kill all the clients and
the server and restart from scratch next time.

We don't have a built-in chat client yet, so you might want to run
your favorite IRC or instant messenger client in the background. 


\section{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}

\item[Q] What about firewalls?

\item[A] We changed from RMI to simple sockets, so the game should be
much more firewall-friendly.  The server accepts connections from 
clients on port 1969, and piggybacks return traffic on the same sockets
rather than opening more.  So as long as the client machines have the
ability to connect out to high ports, and the server machine has inbound
port 1969 open, it should work.
