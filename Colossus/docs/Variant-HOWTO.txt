Subject:  How do I use and/or create Variant Pack for Colossus ?

1) How do I use a Variant Pack ?

Just use the 'Load Variant' button and open the
VAR file inside the variant directory, then start
a new game. That should be enough.

2) What's in a Variant Pack ?

A Variant Pack should be a directory (Folder for
MacOS user) containing:

- a VAR file, that describe the other files;
- a CRE, TER and MAP files that describe the variant;
- a 'Battlelands' subdirectory that contain the new and/or changed Battlelands;
- an 'images' subidirectory that contain the new and/or changed pictures.

3) How do I create a Variant Pack ?

Well, there's no 'user-friendly' way yet. The easiest way is
to build the directory and copy the default files in it,
then you can change them with any text editor. The contents
of the files are described in 'docs/FileFormat/txt'. You can
also use other Variants as examples.

Warning: almost no sanity check is performed, and some
combinations might give strange and/or unexpected result,
particurly in Battlelands (slope next to a tree, or
cliff between two bogs...). Also, ensuring consistency
between the files is up to the Variant author.

Battlelands can also be created using the graphical
tool 'BattlelandsBuilder'. See inside the 'docs/datatools'
directory for additional informations.

There may be an easier (read: graphical) way later for
CRE, TER and MAP files, but don't hold your breath, nobody
is working on it (yet).

FAQ:

1) My creature won't load !
2) My creature is displayed as a dull grey square !

Creature's name (the first column of a CRE file) should not
contain space or other non-alphabetical character (you
can't use digits yet). So, don't create "Killer Rabbit 2"
but create "KillerRabbitTwo" instead.

The creature's name is also used as the base name
of the pictures. So a "KillerRabbitTwo" will use
the file "KillerRabbitTwo.gif" in the subdirectory
"images".

You should be able to re-use an existing name, as
the 'images' directory is accessed before the default
GIF files.
