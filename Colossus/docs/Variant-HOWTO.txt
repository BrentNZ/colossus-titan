Subject:  How do I use and/or create Variant Pack for Colossus ?

1) How do I use a Variant Pack ?

Just use the 'Load Variant' button and open the
VAR file inside the variant directory, then start
a new game. That should be enough.

2) What's in a Variant Pack ?

A Variant Pack should be a directory (Folder for
MacOS user) containing:

- a VAR file, that describe the other files;
- a CRE, TER and MAP files that describe the variant;
- a 'Battlelands' subdirectory that contain the new and/or changed Battlelands;
- an 'images' subidirectory that contain the new and/or changed pictures.

3) How do I create a Variant Pack ?

Well, there's no 'user-friendly' way yet. The easiest way is
to build the directory and copy the default files in it,
then you can change them with any text editor. The contents
of the files are described in 'docs/FileFormat/txt'. You can
also use other Variants as examples.

Warning: almost no sanity check is performed, and some
combinations might give strange and/or unexpected result,
particurly in Battlelands (slope next to a tree, or
cliff between two bogs...). Also, ensuring consistency
between the files is up to the Variant author.

There may be an easier (read: graphical) way later, but
don't hold your breath, nobody is working on it (yet).
