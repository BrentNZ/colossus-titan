<h1>Play Colossus (Titan) Online!</h1>

If you were looking for a way how to play Titan online, then you are (almost) right here!
<p>
"Colossus is a Java clone of the boardgame Titan, a turn-based fantasy wargame for 2-6 players. 
Each player moves stacks of creatures around a strategic board, recruiting more creatures and fighting enemy stacks on tactical maps."

<p>

Now, this page here is just for information purposes. Colossus, and playing Colossus online, 
is a pure (standalone) Java application, i.e. it is not an applet which you can play e.g. inside your web browser.
<p>
You can start Colossus via Java Web Start from the <a href="http://colossus.sourceforge.net/">Colossus home page</a>, or you can download a zip file from 
the download area of our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/colossus/">SourceForge project page</a> and start it locally.


<h3>How does it work</h3>

Really really in a nutshell:
<ol>
<li>Start Colossus</li>
<li>Get used how to use Colossus to play Titan locally, e.g. against the AIs ("Artificial Intelligence", i.e. robot players)
<li>Once you are familiar how to play Colossus, from inside Colossus (Game Setup dialog), click "Run web client"</li>
<li>Sign up/Register</li>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Change to the <b>Create or Join</b> tab</li>
<li>Check instant games and/or scheduled games</li>
<li>If there is some suitable game already proposed by somebody, enroll to it</li>
<li>Otherwise, Propose one by yourself and hope/wait for somebody else to join it</li>
<li>When enough players are enrolled to a game (and they are all online, and, for a scheduled game, the time has come), 
    one of the players can click the <b>Start</b> button.<br />
    You instead might also wait a little longer to get perhaps more players into this game.
<li>There is also a very simple/primitive Chat (<b>Chat</b> tab) available</li>
<li>Logout
<li>Go To 5. ;-)

</ol>
 
<h3>How ready is this?</h3>

Hm, to answer that I have to first distinct between Colossus itself and the Public Game Server:

<h4>Plain Colossus</h4>
Colossus itself, to play it locally with several players, or against AIs, or even play via TCP/IP to anybody 
out there in the Internet, is already quite mature and stable - I would say, at least about 2 years now 
(let's say, since begin of 2008). So, this is pretty ready and mature. (There are tons of things we would want to improve
and what users requested and wanted to improve, but in general it works fine.)
<p>
The problem always was to find somebody to play against, and one of the players had to configure his firewall 
and usually the NAT settings in the DSL box to enable other players to connect to his computer.
(sounds complicated? Yeah... exactly - that's the problem ;-)

<h4>The Public Game Server</h4>

So, we were always asked: <i>How do I find somebody to play?</i>
<p>
Over the last about two years, I (Clemens, aka CleKa), have been working on some software I called 
initially "WebServer" and "WebClient". Technically, the term is probably misleading, because it has nothing
to do with a "Web Server" like people understand it, to use their web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, ...) 
to go to some web page and see or do something.
Anyway I wanted a short, handy name for the baby under development and that is how it is named...
<p>
Nowadays I refer to this mostly as "The Colossus Public Game Server". Or, the Public Game Server (PGS) is the 
server (machine, host, thing-that-has-an-IP-address) that runs the server side part of the application, and users
run a client part of the PGS functionality. In practice that is part of the normal Colossus.jar executable,
so what does it all matter ;-)
<p>
The server went officially public (I started the server part, and announced it so that people could start trying it),
on December 25, 2009, in kind of "alpha" phase.
<p>
Naturally there were some troubles here and there, but overall it worked better than I personally had expected. 
<p>
I fixed those issues (there are still some, I know), and by now (January 10, 2010), I would say we can consider 
the Colossus PGS to be in beta-testing phase.
