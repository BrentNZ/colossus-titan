Suspected Java bugs:

Linux, Sun 1.2.2/1.3beta/1.3betarefresh, Blackdown 1.2.2RC4:
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper 
   left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct location. 
   Seems to be fixed in Solaris and Linux 1.3 final.

Win98, jdk1.3: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris, jdk1.3; Linux, Blackdown jdk1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't 
   work.  They work okay in Win98 jdk1.3.



Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Solaris, jdk1.3; Win98, jdk1.3: BattleMap menu is not immediately active.  
   It takes a few seconds to wake up.

Linux, Solaris, jdk1.3: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Are modal dialogs moving behind other windows before being destroyed?
   Added setVisible(false) before dispose() calls, which doesn't seem
   to help.  SplitLegion and PickRecruit (both called from Game) seem
   to be the main culprits.  Also AcquireAngel.  Doesn't seem to happen
   in Win98.
