SUSPECTED JAVA BUGS:

Linux and Solaris 1.2.2 - 1.3.1:
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper
   left or lower left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct
   location.

Win98 1.3 - 1.3.1: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris 1.3; Linux 1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't work.  They work okay
   in Win98 1.3.

Linux 1.4b: Problems running to a remote X display.  Some of the
   startup dialogs never show up.  Behind the MasterBoard?

Linux, Solaris, 1.3 - 1.3.1: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Doesn't happen in Win98.

Win98, 1.3.1: Windows don't always pop to the front when show() is
   called.  Works fine in Linux and Solaris.

Linux, 1.3.1, fvwm2: Problems with dialog resizing.  Doesn't seem to
   happen with other window managers.  Commented out 
   setResizable(false) in all dialogs as a workaround.




AI BUGS:

AI Legions completely miss the risk of staying in their current hex.  
   For example, 2-high titan legion in H4 saw no risk from enemy 
   6-high legion in D7, when it could have easily moved to safety.
   I think this logic is backwards.

AI attacking ranger is way too aggressive on the first turn, moving 
   adjacent to two enemy trolls rather than sitting back and rangestriking.

AI tit/3*ser/ang stack in 115 rolled a 1 and moved into tower to take 
   warlock, instead of moving to jungle for another serpent.

Attacking AI is way too happy to take a time loss.  Need to crank up
   aggression in the last few turns of battle.

A doomed lion with no allies left struck back against an unwounded 
   cyclops (which it can't kill) instead of a gargoyle (which it can).
   AI needs to understand when it's in its last phase.

6-high AI legion next to top circle with colossi did not grab another
   colossus, for no good reason.

AI defender in battle left reinforcement cyclops off board, when it 
   had room to enter.

Battle AI needs to attack enemy titans more.

Attacking AI guardian stayed 2 hexes away from defending angel for
   several turns and took time loss.  If it had approached angel,
   would have probably been a mutual instead.

AI needs to be more careful about protecting Titan. 

Legions full of trolls/ogres/clopses should try harder to
   avoid the desert.  (Ditto for non-natives attacking into
   marsh, swamp, brush, jungle...)

Give some value to sitting in native terrain.  

MinimaxAI's advancePhase() calls are broken?  8-high starting stack split,
   rolled 6, processed a bunch, and illegally recombined.

At end of game, with MultimaxAI player:
Gold rolls a 6 for movement

MinimaxAI advances phases and turns illegally while a human player is trying
   to enter the battle map.

Turn 1, AI in tower 600 rolled 6, moved legions to 136 and 38.  One of those
   moves was illegal.



PROGRAMMING BUGS:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Loading in the middle of a battle resets turn
   number to 1 while leaving critters in the middle of the
   map, keeps the map around after the battle is over, etc.  It's
   a mess.

Solaris, 1.3.1: Popup windows pop up in the wrong place if the window 
   has been scrolled.  
Scrollbars do not immediately appear / disappear after a rescale().

All enemy creatures are invisible after loading a game.

Did File/New while winning AI was playing against itself:
Maybe we need to sleep for a second to let the timer events clear out?

Need to better stop phase advancing on draw, not just win.  Human player
   ended up AI-controlled after draw.

Zero-height legion's (caused by angel being summoned out) marker
   doesn't go away.
Lost a legion marker somewhere?  Try to reproduce.  (Maybe with 1-high 
   angels stacks?)


Red battle hex highlighting clashes with volcano.

Save game in first turn's move phase, after rolling 6.  Load game, 
   movement roll shows up as -1 in title, no die shown, but works 
   as 6.  Need to fix movement phase initialization timing from 
   loadGame() path.

First recruit of each game is very slow.  So is first SummonAngel if no
   previous recruits.  Handle some initialization in a background thread
   started earlier?

Need to reveal legion contents to each other during negotiation.  Requires
   per-client memory of enemy stacks.

Can't play with more than one human player.  Does not allow first human to
   split starting stack.  Works for me -- try to reproduce in Win98.

Did file/new game while game was being set up.  Got comodification exception.

Stuff (markers, LogWindow) that is painted before the MasterBoard is ready
   end up dumping pixels onto the upper-left corner of the MasterFrame.
   Need to setVisible(false) on master frame until later?  Or just force
   a full repaint after initialization is done?

Need to re-highlight strikers or carries after choosing a strike penalty.

Game does not advance past the strike phase automatically after a carry if no
   strikes/carries left.

Partial (top half only) repaints of some chits' hits , dead X during battle.
   Try to fix by calling setDead / setHits from the Client tell* methods. 

Engagement hex not unselected after human player loses sole battle.
   Phase does not automatically advance.

AcquireAngel at end of game can't be cancelled with Cancel button.
   acquiring=false in kickEngagements

Variants not loading from jar files, local or JWS.
