Suspected Java bugs:

Linux and Solaris 1.2.2 - 1.3.1:
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper
   left or lower left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct
   location.

Win98 1.3 - 1.3.1: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris 1.3; Linux 1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't work.  They work okay
   in Win98 1.3.

Linux 1.4b: Problems running to a remote X display.  Some of the
   startup dialogs never show up.  Behind the MasterBoard?

Linux, Solaris, 1.3 - 1.3.1: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Doesn't happen in Win98.

Win98, 1.3.1: Windows don't always pop to the front when show() is
   called.  Works fine in Linux and Solaris.


Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Win98, 1.3.1: Focus keeps moving to MovementDie and BattleDice, which
   disrupts keyboard shortcuts.  Doesn't happen with StatusScreen.
   Doesn't happen in Unix.  Does happen in Linux 1.4.0b2, at least with
   MovementDie.

Solaris, 1.3.1: Loading in the middle of a battle resets turn
   number to 1 while leaving critters in the middle of the
   map, keeps the map around after the battle is over, etc.  It's
   a mess.

Win98, 1.3.1: AI Legions sometimes miss the risk of staying in their
   current hex.  For example, 2-high titan legion in H4 saw no
   risk from enemy 6-high legion in D7, when it could have easily
   moved to safety.

Solaris, 1.3.1: AI attacking ranger is way too aggressive on the
   first turn, moving adjacent to two enemy trolls rather than
   sitting back and rangestriking.

Solaris, 1.3.1: AI tit/3*ser/ang stack in 115 rolled a 1 and moved
   into tower to take warlock, instead of moving to jungle for
   another serpent.

Solaris, 1.3.1: Popup windows (e.g. ShowMasterHex) pop up in the wrong
   place if the window has been scrolled.  Scrollbars do not immediately
   appear / disappear after a rescale().

Win98, 1.3.1-1.4b: Turn 1, player started in tower 300.  Rolled a 6.  Titan
   to tower 400, got "teleport or move normally" prompt despite the
   fact that it could only get there by teleporting.  Angel to marsh
   22, got same prompt even though titan already teleported.  Still there.
Solaris, 1.3.1: Titan teleport to faraway enemy, undo move, repeat move.
   Got "teleport or move normally prompt" even though only teleporting
   would work.

Win98, 1.4b: Currently have to pick recruiter even with "all stacks visible"
   set.

Solaris, 1.3.1: All enemy creatures are invisible after loading a game.

Attacking AI is way too happy to take a time loss.  Need to crank up
   aggression in the last few turns of battle.

In evalutateCritterMove(), buddies is always 0.

Did File/New while winning AI was playing against itself:
Maybe we need to sleep for a second to let the timer events clear out?

A doomed lion with no allies left struck back against an unwounded 
   cyclops (which it can't kill) instead of a gargoyle (which it can).

Zero-height legion's (caused by angel being summoned out) marker
   doesn't go away.

Need to better stop phase advancing on draw, not just win.  Human player
   ended up AI-controlled after draw.

AI does not recruit post-battle reinforcements.

6-high AI legion next to top circle with colossi did not grab another
   colossus, for no good reason.

AI defender in battle left reinforcement cyclops off board, when it 
   had room to enter.

Battle AI needs to attack enemy titans more.

Attacking AI guardian stayed 2 hexes away from defending angel for
   several turns and took time loss.  If it had approached angel,
   would have probably been a mutual instead.
