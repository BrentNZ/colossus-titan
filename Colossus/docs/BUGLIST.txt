Suspected Java bugs:

Linux, Sun 1.2.2/1.3beta/1.3betarefresh, Blackdown 1.2.2RC4:
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper 
   left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct location. 
   Seems to be fixed in Solaris and Linux 1.3 final.

Win98, jdk1.3: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris, jdk1.3; Linux, Blackdown jdk1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't 
   work.  They work okay in Win98 jdk1.3.

Win98, jdk1.3: Popup menus are not erased properly.  They erase fine
   in Linux and Solaris jdk 1.3.


Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Linux, Solaris, jdk1.3: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Are modal dialogs moving behind other windows before being destroyed?
   Added setVisible(false) before dispose() calls, which doesn't seem
   to help.  SplitLegion and PickRecruit (both called from Game) seem
   to be the main culprits.  Also AcquireAngel.  Doesn't seem to happen
   in Win98.

Serpent has 2 targets, angel and archangel, both up dune hexsides
   with same penalty.  Was not allowed to carry.  Should have been.

Split.  Left click on small stack.  Right click on large stack.  Click
   on destination hex.  Small stack moves, though large stack is on top.

--latest finds savegames with non-numeric filenames, and always uses
   them in preference to those with normal numeric filenames.

All creatures are invisible after loading a game.

Defender dies.  Battle phase advances to Move.  
   Battle phase advances to Fight.  Defender's battle turn, number X
