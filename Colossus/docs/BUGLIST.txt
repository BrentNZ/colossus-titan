Suspected Java bugs:

Linux, Sun 1.2.2/1.3beta/1.3betarefresh, Blackdown 1.2.2RC4:
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper
   left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct location.
   Seems to be fixed in Solaris and Linux 1.3 final.

Win98, jdk1.3: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris, jdk1.3; Linux, Blackdown jdk1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't
   work.  They work okay in Win98 jdk1.3.

Win98, jdk1.3: Popup menus are not erased properly.  They erase fine
   in Linux and Solaris jdk 1.3.

Solaris, jdk1.3: During split phase, on turn 20 of a 6-player game:
"An unexpected exception has been detected in native code outside the 
VM. Program counter=0xed5b2748 Problematic Thread: prio=6 tid=0xf4e58 
nid=0xd runnable Abort (core dumped)"



Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Linux, Solaris, jdk1.3: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Are modal dialogs moving behind other windows before being destroyed?
   Added setVisible(false) before dispose() calls, which doesn't seem
   to help.  SplitLegion and PickRecruit (both called from Game) seem
   to be the main culprits.  Also AcquireAngel.  Doesn't seem to happen
   in Win98.

Serpent has 2 targets, angel and archangel, both up dune hexsides
   with same penalty.  Was not allowed to carry.  Should have been.

Split.  Left click on small stack.  Right click on large stack.  Click
   on destination hex.  Small stack moves, though large stack is on top.

With two friendly stacks in the same hex after a split, right-clicking
   on both in succession sometimes does not immediately repaint the
   one that should be on top.  Hard to reproduce.  Clicking elsewhere
   on the board and forcing a full repaint fixes this, so it appears
   that the Z-order is correct but a repaint() call is missing.

--latest finds savegames with non-numeric filenames, and always uses
   them in preference to those with normal numeric filenames.

All creatures are invisible after loading a game.  Is
   Player.resetTurnState() being called inappropriately?

Defender dies.  Battle phase advances to Move.
   Battle phase advances to Fight.  Defender's battle turn, number X
Defender dies.  (in strikeback).  Attacker's battle turn, numberX
Attacking titan dies.  Attacker's battle turn, number X.
   Battle phase advances to Move.

Post-battle angel summoning is messed up.  Usually hexes with eligible
   donor legions are highlighted, but the SummonAngel dialog does not
   appear unless the donor is right-clicked.  Once the donor highlighting
   interfered with recruit highlighting, which was fixed with undo
   all recruits.  Is the SummonAngel dialog showing up behind the
   MasterBoard?

Cyclops entered battle map with 4 hits already.  Failed to heal after
   last battle?

Win98, jdk1.3: Focus keeps moving to MovementDie and BattleDice, which 
   disrupts keyboard shortcuts.  Doesn't happen with StatusScreen.
   Doesn't happen in Unix.

Linux, jdk1.3: Time loss, titan-on-titan battle with last 2 players
   Battle phase advances to Fight
Battle phase advances to Strikeback
Time loss
Legion Gr01 (Cauldron) [Titan] is eliminated

Solaris, 1.3: "tower teleports (null)" when all stacks visible.
   Should fill in a random lord from the stack instead.

Solaris, 1.3: Can post-battle angel summon from an engaged
   donor legion.  SummonAngel dialog appeared during movement
   phase!

Solaris, 1.3: When clicking on engagement:

Solaris, 1.3: Dead titan, but player keeps going.  Need to check
   for player death more often to work around this bug?
