Suspected Java bugs:

Win95, jdk 1.1.7, 1.2, 1.2.1: OutOfMemory error -- Image memory leak.
   This inevitably causes the game to crash, unless you have a huge
   amount of memory and allocate it to java.  Fixed in 1.1.8 and 1.2.2.

Win95, 1.1.7: BattleTurn: "Done with Mov..."; default button size is
   too small for its label.

Red Hat 6.1, kaffe 1.05
   Background colors are different.  (e.g. white instead of black.)  They're 
      being set rather than defaulted.
   Some clicks are rejected as though not inside chits or hexes even though
      they are.  Sometimes a second click works; sometimes it takes several
      tries.
   Problems with PickMarker at the start of the game.  The first player's
      markers are not displayed, but clicking in the place where they
      should be works.  Some clicks are repeatedly missed, which prevents
      progressing to the game.

Blackdown 117v3: Legion markers on the MasterBoard or BattleMap do not 
   display correctly on a remote Linux or Solaris X display (need to
   test with Win98 and X-Win32).  The same GIFs display fine in dialogs.
   1.2pre2 works correctly, though the GIFs load a bit slowly.  ibmjdk118
   works fine.

jar files made in Linux ibmjdk118 won't execute directly on Solaris JDK 1.2.2.
   They'll run on Windows (JDK 1.3beta), and with "java -jar" on Solaris. 
   Bad magic numbers?  Problem with jexec?

Red Hat 6.1, ibmjdk118: Occasional SIGSEGV javacore in SplitLegion, with 
   native threads on.  Green threads seem okay.  Occasional SIGSEGV 
   javacore in PickRecruit, even with green threads.  One SIGSEGV
   javacore during battle, with green threads.  AWT thread race condition?

Red Hat 6.1, Sun 1.2.2/1.3/1.3refresh, Blackdown 1.2.2RC4: 
   ShowDice dialog sometimes moves from upper right corner to upper 
   left corner.  ShowLegion dialog sometimes pops up in upper left 
   corner instead of over mouse position.  These problems don't happen 
   with ibmjdk118.

Win98, JDK1.3: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Works fine on other JDKs.

Win98, jdk1.3: Multiple fast right-clicks on a MasterHex do not succeed
   in displaying ShowBattleMap.  They do result in a ShowMasterHex that
   cannot be dismissed, except by left-clicking on a chit within it.

Win98, jdk1.3: Bad repaint onto potential carry target with no carries.

Solaris, jdk1.2.2, jdk1.3: Popup menu text is invisible 
   black-on-black.  There is no way to set the background and 
   foreground colors.

Solaris, jdk1.2.2: jar files made in Linux won't execute.
   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Game

Win98, jdk1.3; Solaris, jdk1.3: OutOfMemoryException starting a battle in 
   turn 15 of a 4-player game.  Also during turn 45 of a 5-player game.
   Also during movement phase of turn 14 of a 6-player game.
   Image memory leak again?  Or somewhere else?


Current programming bugs:

Win98, Linux, Solaris; jdk 1.1.7, 1.2, 1.3, ibm118, kaffe 1.0b5, etc.: 
   Sometimes not all targets are highlighted on the first click on a
   potential striker.  Both hex.select() and hex.repaint() are being 
   called, but the repaint is occasionally failing.  Clicking again 
   almost always highlights the rest; a third click always seems to
   work.  Extra repaint() calls don't help.  This looks like some kind 
   of AWT thread sync issue, but I'm calling select() and repaint()
   directly from the mousePressed() event handler like I'm supposed to.

Linux, ibmjdk118: 2 possible carries, ogre was highlighted as a carry
   target, but clicking on it did not apply damage and wasted the
   carry.

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Solaris: Makefile no longer works.  Target "classes" isn't working
   properly.  Why not?  It works fine under Linux.  Both use GNU make 
   3.77.

Linux, ibmjdk118: Drift damage was not applied to a cyclops.

Linux, ibmjdk118: Legion with angel in tower did not immediately
   have tower teleport moves highlighted, as if player had already
   teleported.  "Undo All Moves" fixed the problem.
   
Linux, ibmjdk118: Got a NullPointerException in Concede.<init>

Linux, ibmjdk13: Repainting of stacked chits in battlemap entry
   hex is ugly.  Chits in front are not fully redrawn.

Linux, ibmjdk118: Angel summoned into battle can move on top of
   any of its allies which has not moved yet, because their hexes 
   are highlighted.

Linux, ibmjdk118; Win98, jdk1.3rc1: Tried to strike own creature!

Linux, ibmjdk118: Numbers (sometimes overlapping) appear in the 
   upper left corner of the MasterBoard window after loading a game.  
   Stray legion heights?  They disappear in a repaint after a few 
   turns.

Solaris, jdk1.3: Clicks on ShowMasterHex are ignored unless they're
   on chits.

Linux, ibmjdk118; Solaris, jdk1.3: Battle did not end once when a 
   player died.  BattleTurn was not dismissed, and the game could 
   not continue.  Happened multiple times -- see 968280760325.sav 
   (movement 3), 970008244885.sav  Player.die() was called.
   When the dying Titan ended the game, the following exception
   was seen:
