Suspected Java bugs:

Linux and Solaris 1.2.2 - 1.3.1: 
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper
   left or lower left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct 
   location.

Win98 1.3 - 1.3.1: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris 1.3; Linux 1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't work.  They work okay 
   in Win98 1.3.

Win98 1.3: Popup menus are not erased properly.  They erase fine
   in Linux and Solaris 1.3.

Linux 1.4b: Problems running to a remote X display.  Some of the
   startup dialogs never show up.  Behind the MasterBoard?

Linux, Solaris, 1.3: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Doesn't happen in Win98.


Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

--latest finds savegames with non-numeric filenames, and always uses
   them in preference to those with normal numeric filenames.

Win98, 1.3: Focus keeps moving to MovementDie and BattleDice, which 
   disrupts keyboard shortcuts.  Doesn't happen with StatusScreen.
   Doesn't happen in Unix.

Solaris, 1.3.1: Loading in the middle of a battle resets turn
   number to 1 while leaving critters in the middle of the
   map, keeps the map around after the battle is over, etc.  It's
   a mess.

Win98, 1.3.1: AI Legions sometimes miss the risk of staying in their
   current hex.  For example, 2-high titan legion in H4 saw no
   risk from enemy 6-high legion in D7, when it could have easily
   moved to safety.

Solaris, 1.3.1: AI attacking ranger is way too aggressive on the
   first turn, moving adjacent to two enemy trolls rather than
   sitting back and rangestriking.

Solaris, 1.3.1: AI tit/3*ser/ang stack in 115 rolled a 1 and moved
   into tower to take warlock, instead of moving to jungle for
   another serpent.

Solaris, 1.3.1: Popup windows (e.g. ShowMasterHex) pop up in the wrong
   place if the window has been scrolled.  Scrollbars do not immediately
   appear / disappear after a rescale().

Win98, 1.3.1-1.4b: Turn 1, player started in tower 300.  Rolled a 6.  Titan
   to tower 400, got "teleport or move normally" prompt despite the
   fact that it could only get there by teleporting.  Angel to marsh
   22, got same prompt even though titan already teleported.

Solaris, 1.3.1: MovementDie is appearing mostly off right edge of the
   screen.  StatusScreen is appearing with its bottom edge off the
   bottom of the screen.

Win98, 1.4b: Some creatures are visible that shouldn't be.

Win98, 1.4b: Attacking AI creatures aren't aggressive enough near the end
   of battles, which causes time losses. 

Win98, 1.4b: Chits are placed slightly off-center in battle hexes.





Current hot bugs:

Currently have to pick recruiter even with "all stacks visible" set.

One player's info dialogs block all other players.  No real solution
   until we add threaded events.

Some creatures show up on the battlemap but can't be clicked.  Not just
   summoned angels.  "Engaged creature must strike" but can't click on
   creature so battle sticks.  Bad chits vs. critter tag.  Chit is there,
   but battle.getCritter() returns null, because chit's tag does not
   match any critter's tag.  Removing battle chits from client at the
   end of each battle doesn't help.

BattleDice is not being dismissed at end of combat.

Game zoomed past human player's split, move, fight phases to muster.
   Is this a problem with a leftover 'D' characters in the buffer, or
   with the AI calling advancePhase() too many times?  Human player's
   legion was auto-split even with autoSplit option off, so it appears
   that the wrong player's info is being used.  Can't undo the split,
   because the game moves forward to movement.  Once it happens, it
   keeps happening every turn.

AI defender enters map, phase advances to human player's move, but
   map goes inactive as if a modal dialog were pending somewhere.
   Fixed by skipping negotiation.   Also happens when AI attacker
   attacks human defender -- not fixed there.  Concede?
   Doesn't happen immediately after loading a game -- some flag stuck?
