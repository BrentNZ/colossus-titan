Suspected Java bugs:

Linux, Sun 1.2.2/1.3beta/1.3betarefresh, Blackdown 1.2.2RC4:
   ShowDice dialog sometimes moves from upper right corner to upper
   left corner.  ShowLegion dialog sometimes pops up in upper left
   corner instead of over mouse position.  These problems don't happen
   with ibmjdk118.  Seems to be fixed in Solaris 1.3 final.  Try Linux
   jdk 1.3 final.

Win98, jdk1.3: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks.

Solaris, jdk1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't work.  They work okay in
   Win98 jdk1.3.  Linux?


Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Linux, ibmjdk118: Drift damage was not applied to a cyclops.

Linux, ibmjdk118: Legion with angel in tower did not immediately
   have tower teleport moves highlighted, as if player had already
   teleported.  "Undo All Moves" fixed the problem.

Linux, ibmjdk118: Angel summoned into battle can move on top of
   any of its allies which has not moved yet, because their hexes
   are highlighted.

Solaris, jdk1.3: Tried to strike allied <creature>

Solaris, jdk1.3: Sometimes moving a chit onto its own hex in battle
   eliminates that chit's movement options.  "Undo last move" works.

Solaris, jdk1.3; Win98, jdk1.3: Mutual elimination, with defender's
   titan killed.  Got the message "Legion XXXX is eliminated" twice
   for the attacking legion, once for the defender.  OK when just
   attacking titan is killed.  For a mutual with no titans, the
   message appears twice for each legion: A, D, A, D.
Fixed this, but now we again have the problem where a dead 
   defender's next turn happens.  ("Battle phase advances to Move,
   Player's battle turn, number 5")

Solaris, jdk1.3: Square (red, black, or white) in NW corner of board
   and map.  Partial marker?  Doesn't appear on board when
   board.loadInitialMarkerImages() isn't called.  Is repainted when
   board is minimized and restored.  In battle, it sometimes looks
   like the color of the attacker's markers, but is sometimes two-toned,
   and sometimes changes color.

Solaris, jdk1.3: BattleMap menu is not immediately active.  It takes a
   few seconds to wake up.

Win98, jdk1.3: ShowDice steals keyboard focus from BattleMap.  Fixed by
   change to JFrame?

Solaris, jdk1.3: showDice option has no effect in the middle of a battle.
