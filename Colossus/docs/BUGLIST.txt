Suspected Java bugs:

Linux and Solaris 1.2.2 - 1.3.1: 
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper
   left or lower left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct 
   location.

Win98 1.3: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris 1.3; Linux 1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't work.  They work okay 
   in Win98 1.3.

Win98 1.3: Popup menus are not erased properly.  They erase fine
   in Linux and Solaris 1.3.

Solaris 1.4b: SplitLegion does not repaint chits properly.
Solaris 1.4b: Ugly full MasterBoard repaints after battles, after
   ShowLegion dialogs are dismissed, etc.
Linux 1.4b: Problems running to a remote X display.  Some of the
   startup dialogs never show up.  Behind the MasterBoard?



Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Linux, Solaris, 1.3: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Are modal dialogs moving behind other windows before being destroyed?
   Added setVisible(false) before dispose() calls, which doesn't seem
   to help.  SplitLegion and PickRecruit (both called from Game) seem
   to be the main culprits.  Also AcquireAngel.  Doesn't happen in Win98.

Serpent has 2 targets, angel and archangel, both up dune hexsides
   with same penalty.  Was not allowed to carry.  Should have been.

--latest finds savegames with non-numeric filenames, and always uses
   them in preference to those with normal numeric filenames.

Battle phases continue after the battle should be over:
   Defender dies.  Battle phase advances to Move.
      Battle phase advances to Fight.  Defender's battle turn, number X
   Defender dies.  (in strikeback).  Attacker's battle turn, numberX
   Attacking titan dies.  Attacker's battle turn, number X.
      Battle phase advances to Move.

Win98, 1.3: Focus keeps moving to MovementDie and BattleDice, which 
   disrupts keyboard shortcuts.  Doesn't happen with StatusScreen.
   Doesn't happen in Unix.

Linux, 1.3: Time loss, titan-on-titan battle with last 2 players:
Battle phase advances to Fight
Battle phase advances to Strikeback
Time loss
Legion Gr01 (Cauldron) [Titan] is eliminated

Solaris, 1.3.1: Loading in the middle of a battle resets turn
   number to 1 while leaving critters in the middle of the
   map, keeps the map around after the battle is over, etc.  It's
   a mess.

Win98, 1.3.1: Human-controlled legions are staying highlighted
   after summoning or splitting, again.  They un-highlight after
   moving.  unselect() and repaint() are being called.  Problem
   does not always happen right after loading a game.

Win98, 1.3.1: Legions sometimes miss the risk of staying in their
   current hex.  For example, 2-high titan legion in H4 saw no
   risk from enemy 6-high legion in D7, when it could have easily
   moved to safety.
