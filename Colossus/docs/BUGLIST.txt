Suspected Java bugs:

Linux and Solaris 1.2.2 - 1.3.1:
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper
   left or lower left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct
   location.

Win98 1.3 - 1.3.1: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris 1.3; Linux 1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't work.  They work okay
   in Win98 1.3.

Linux 1.4b: Problems running to a remote X display.  Some of the
   startup dialogs never show up.  Behind the MasterBoard?

Linux, Solaris, 1.3 - 1.3.1: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Doesn't happen in Win98.

Win98, 1.3.1: Windows don't always pop to the front when show() is
   called.  Works fine in Linux and Solaris.


Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Win98, 1.3.1: Focus keeps moving to MovementDie and BattleDice, which
   disrupts keyboard shortcuts.  Doesn't happen with StatusScreen.
   Doesn't happen in Unix.

Solaris, 1.3.1: Loading in the middle of a battle resets turn
   number to 1 while leaving critters in the middle of the
   map, keeps the map around after the battle is over, etc.  It's
   a mess.

Win98, 1.3.1: AI Legions sometimes miss the risk of staying in their
   current hex.  For example, 2-high titan legion in H4 saw no
   risk from enemy 6-high legion in D7, when it could have easily
   moved to safety.

Solaris, 1.3.1: AI attacking ranger is way too aggressive on the
   first turn, moving adjacent to two enemy trolls rather than
   sitting back and rangestriking.

Solaris, 1.3.1: AI tit/3*ser/ang stack in 115 rolled a 1 and moved
   into tower to take warlock, instead of moving to jungle for
   another serpent.

Solaris, 1.3.1: Popup windows (e.g. ShowMasterHex) pop up in the wrong
   place if the window has been scrolled.  Scrollbars do not immediately
   appear / disappear after a rescale().

Win98, 1.3.1-1.4b: Turn 1, player started in tower 300.  Rolled a 6.  Titan
   to tower 400, got "teleport or move normally" prompt despite the
   fact that it could only get there by teleporting.  Angel to marsh
   22, got same prompt even though titan already teleported.  Still there.

Win98, 1.4b: Currently have to pick recruiter even with "all stacks visible"
   set.

Solaris, 1.3.1: All enemy creatures are invisible after loading a game.

Prompt to avoid skipping recruits?

Need prettier question.gif

Attacking AI is way too happy to take a time loss.  Need to crank up
   aggression in the last few turns of battle.

File/New Game is broken.  The board is disposed but not recreated.
