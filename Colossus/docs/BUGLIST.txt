Suspected Java bugs:

Linux, Sun 1.2.2/1.3beta/1.3betarefresh, Blackdown 1.2.2RC4:
   BattleDice dialog sometimes moves from upper right corner to upper
   left corner.  ShowLegion dialog sometimes pops up in upper left
   corner instead of over mouse position.  Seems to be fixed in Solaris 
   and Linux 1.3 final.

Win98, jdk1.3: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris, jdk1.3; Linux, Blackdown jdk1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't 
   work.  They work okay in Win98 jdk1.3.



Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Solaris, jdk1.3: Tried to strike allied <creature>

Solaris, jdk1.3: Sometimes moving a chit onto its own hex in battle
   eliminates that chit's movement options.  "Undo last move" works.

Solaris, jdk1.3; Win98, jdk1.3: Mutual elimination, with defender's
   titan killed.  Got the message "Legion XXXX is eliminated" twice
   for the attacking legion, once for the defender.  OK when just
   attacking titan is killed.  For a mutual with no titans, the
   message appears twice for each legion: A, D, A, D.
Fixed this, but now we again have the problem where a dead 
   defender's next turn happens.  ("Battle phase advances to Move,
   Player's battle turn, number 5")

Solaris, jdk1.3; Win98, jdk1.3: BattleMap menu is not immediately active.  
   It takes a few seconds to wake up.

Linux, Solaris, jdk1.3: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Are modal dialogs moving behind other windows before being destroyed?
   Added setVisible(false) before dispose() calls, which doesn't seem
   to help.  SplitLegion and PickRecruit (both called from Game) seem
   to be the main culprits.  Also AcquireAngel.  Doesn't seem to happen
   in Win98.
