Suspected Java bugs:

Linux and Solaris 1.2.2 - 1.3.1: 
   BattleDice and ShowLegion dialogs sometimes appear in the upper
   left or lower left corner of the screen, instead of in the correct 
   location.

Win98 1.3 - 1.3.1: setLocation() to keep ShowLegion, ShowMasterHex
   dialogs from displaying past the bottom or right edge of the
   screen isn't working.  Screen size is detected properly, unless
   resolution is changed while the application is running.  Works
   fine on other jdks, Solaris, Linux.

Solaris 1.3; Linux 1.3: JPopupMenu mnemonics don't work.  They work okay 
   in Win98 1.3.

Win98 1.3: Popup menus are not erased properly.  They erase fine
   in Linux and Solaris 1.3.

Solaris 1.4b: SplitLegion does not repaint chits properly.
Solaris 1.4b: Ugly full MasterBoard repaints after battles, after
   ShowLegion dialogs are dismissed, etc.
Linux 1.4b: Problems running to a remote X display.  Some of the
   startup dialogs never show up.  Behind the MasterBoard?


Current programming bugs:

Concession timing.  If both players want to concede, the non-phasing
   player (usually?) has the right to concede first.  Concessions
   aren't allowed in the middle of strikes.  Etc.
Striking continues after concession, until the normal time to check for
   creature (and then player) death.

Linux, Solaris, 1.3: Dialogs sometimes beep for no good reason.
   Are modal dialogs moving behind other windows before being destroyed?
   Added setVisible(false) before dispose() calls, which doesn't seem
   to help.  SplitLegion and PickRecruit (both called from Game) seem
   to be the main culprits.  Also AcquireAngel.  Doesn't happen in Win98.

--latest finds savegames with non-numeric filenames, and always uses
   them in preference to those with normal numeric filenames.

Win98, 1.3: Focus keeps moving to MovementDie and BattleDice, which 
   disrupts keyboard shortcuts.  Doesn't happen with StatusScreen.
   Doesn't happen in Unix.

Solaris, 1.3.1: Loading in the middle of a battle resets turn
   number to 1 while leaving critters in the middle of the
   map, keeps the map around after the battle is over, etc.  It's
   a mess.

Win98, 1.3.1: AI Legions sometimes miss the risk of staying in their
   current hex.  For example, 2-high titan legion in H4 saw no
   risk from enemy 6-high legion in D7, when it could have easily
   moved to safety.

Solaris, 1.3.1: AI attacking ranger is way too aggressive on the
   first turn, moving adjacent to two enemy trolls rather than
   sitting back and rangestriking.
