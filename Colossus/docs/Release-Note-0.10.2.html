<h1>Release Note for Colossus 0.10.2</h1>

<p>
Some usability and stability improvements: 
<ul>
<li>If active player dies during battle, server side automatically advances to 
    next player instead of waiting for player finish engagements phase.
    This is related to: "2934399 Turn incomplete in multi-player"</li>
<li>Proposed Games table shows now always both instant and scheduled games, 
    not the ones or the others depending on the radiobutton as earlier.
    Also the action buttons for propose and enroll are active for instant 
    games even if one has an instant game proposed or enrolled,
    now just a popup dialog tells then that and why one can't enroll to or 
    propose an instant game right now</li>
<li>WebClient: when variant changes and new variants max player count differs 
    from previous, then adjust maxSpinner.maxValue (and all spinners current 
    values, if needed)</li>
<li>Added some Public Game Server FAQ document (pretty empty still)</li>
<li>WebClient sends now some Client side version so server knows which 
    features client can handle</li>
<li>Prevent some problems when several players tried to start same game 
    at almost same time. Games would stay hanging, eventually no more games possible</li>
<li>Prevent the illegally called engage() and other warnings and errors</li>
<li>Added some "general notification to user" functionality (popup dialog + beep)
   (so far only admin can send those)</li>
<li>Eliminated the discrepancy between free ports / free game ports which 
    caused a warning on startup of the game server</li>
<li>Fixed the remove/cancel game issues, that it was not deleted from table, 
    or caused exceptions, or whatever</li>
</ul>
