<li>Corrected the text "redisplaying last 50 messages" (from 10 10 50)</li>
<li>Improved text in MasterBoard BottomBar during engagements phase</li>
<li>Added options for: when my (masterboard) turn starts, beep and/or bring my masterboard to front</li>
<li>PGS: when lastOnline was changed (user does login or logoff), write back users file to disk</li>
<li>When webclient user logs out, cancel proposed instant games he created. Also clear running games table and gameHash.</li>
