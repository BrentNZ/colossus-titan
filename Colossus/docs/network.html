        <h2>Networked Colossus</h2>
        <p>Colossus is now playable over a TCP/IP network. However, the network
        functionality is still not perfectly stable. And turn-based games are
        inherently brittle -- if one player stops moving or drops his
        connection, then the game is ruined for everybody. (For now --
        we&#39;ll add the ability to reconnect or have an AI take over later.)
        So I recommend starting with 2-player games rather than 6-player
        games.</p>
        <p>One person needs to run the server. Currently, Colossus servers are
        short-lived, staying up only for the length of one game.</p>
        <p>The server operator simply starts the game as usual, using Java Web
        Start or the 
        <b>run</b>script for a local copy. The startup dialog should appear,
        allowing you to set the variant, optional rules, and how many players
        of which types you want. Human players are local to the server machine.
        Network players are remote. The game will wait for *exactly* the number
        of network players you specify, then start the game. If you have a
        local copy of the game you can use command-line options instead. Use 
        <b>run -h</b>to see them.</p>
        <p>Each client needs to wait for the server to be started, then run the
        
        <b>runclient</b>script or start the game from Java Web Start and select
        &quot;Run client&quot; from the startup dialog. This will pop up a
        small dialog that lets you enter a player name, hostname, and port. The
        player name will default to your OS user name. The server host will
        default to the local machine, which probably isn&#39;t what you want
        unless you&#39;re doing loopback testing. You can use the IP address
        instead of the hostname if you prefer. Most servers will use the
        default port. Again, you can use command-line options instead. 
        <b>runclient -h</b>to see them.</p>
        <p>Once all the clients have connected, then the game should start up
        like a normal Colossus game. When the game ends, kill all the clients
        and the server and restart from scratch if you want to play again.</p>
        <p>There is a simple chat client built in, but it&#39;s not very good.
        I recommend using your favorite IRC or instant messenger client
        instead.</p>
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How do I find opponents? 
            <p>There used to be an IRC channel, but it&#39;s dead. Sorry. We
            should update this document if someone starts a new one.</p></li>
            <li>What about firewalls? 
            <p>The server accepts connections from clients on port 26567 (used
            for game traffic) and 26568 (used to serve files). Return traffic
            is piggybacked on the same sockets rather than opening more. So
            client machines only need the ability to connect out on those
            ports, while server machines need a publicly visible IP address
            with those ports visible through the firewall.</p></li>
            <li>If a network game crashes, can I reload it? 
            <p>Yes, but the procedure is complicated. The server operator needs
            to load the game, then the other players need to rejoin in the
            exact same order as before. This is much easier to coordinate if
            you use an external chat application, like IRC or an instant
            messenger client.</p></li>
