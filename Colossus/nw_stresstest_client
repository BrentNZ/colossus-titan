# This is a remote client for network/remote stresstesting.
# To do network stresstesting, give -R option to fancy_stresstest
# (e.g. -R 2) and start in additional cmdline prompts as many of
# this nw_stresstest_clients as the number given to -R was.

# So, this script here will simply start a new client (with -g option)
# as soon as the previous one finishes (sleeps some second in between).
# It can, same as fancy_stresstest itself, be stopped by creating
# a file stop.flag (although, Ctrl-C would work too... but I think
# this with the stop.flag file is "nicer".
#
# BTW, if fancy_stresstest is started with -N option (e.g. -N 10,
# meaning, do 10 rounds and exit then), it will create that stop.flag
# then by itself so that, if stresstest is run in same machine,
# all the remote clients exit, too...
