<h1>README for Colossus Variant Unified</h1>
         
<h2>What is Unified Titan?</h2>
Unified Titan is an extended version of basic Titan that attempts to add
 to the original Avalon Hill Titan.      
<h2>What has changed with the Titan?<br>
   </h2>
    The Titan is now a skill-factor 5 piece. This yields automatic hits against 
 skill-factor 2 pieces. A Titan gains Titan-Teleport at 1000 points. He still 
 gains a hit-point  every 100 points and&nbsp;recruits &nbsp;an Archangel
at 500 points an Angel at 100 points but also can recruit a Green Dragon
at 100 points as well.<br>
<h2>Dragon? What's a Dragon?</h2>
Unified Titan adds Dragons to the Creatures. Dragons can be recruited when
in one of the 4 Dragon Keeps, colored black, on the masterboard.<br>
<br>
A Green Dragon is a 5-5 creature, and is recruited by any other creature
in the keep.<br>
A Blue Dragon is a 7-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Green Dragon.<br>
A Purple Dragon is a 9-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Blue Dragon.<br>
A Silver Dragon is an 11-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Purple Dragon.<br>
A Black Dragon is a 13-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Silver Dragon.<br>
A Gold Dragon is a 15-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Black Dragon.<br>
A Red Dragon is a 17-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Gold Dragon.<br>
A Balrog is a 20-5 Creature, and is recruited by 1 Red Dragon.<br>
<br>
All Dragons and the Balrog are Flying Rangestrikers, native on slopes and
in volcanos.<br>
<br>
Note: Because of the use of Dragons, the Magog has replaced the Dragon in
the Colossus recruiting tree in the Mountains, but it is identical to the
Dragon in Default Titan, 9-3 Flying Range striker, etc. 
<h2>What has changed on the Battlelands?</h2>
    The Battlelands for Brush, Jungle, Plains, Marsh, Hills, Woods, Desert,
 Swamp, Mountains, and Tundra are as in the default game.<br>
         
<h2>What has changed with the original creatures?</h2>
    Other than the Titan, none of the original creatures has had their stats
  changed, or how they are recruited. Original creatures do have new recruiting
  options in their native terrains.<br>
         
<h2>What are the new creatures and how are they recruited?</h2>
3 Gorgons recruit 1 Manticore in the Brush. A Manticore is a flying rangestriker, 
 8-3.<br>
    3 Behemoth recruit 1 Jabberwok in the Wasteland. A Jabberwok is a 27-2.
<br>
<br>
    2 Rangers recruit 1 Salamander in the Marsh. A Salamander is an 8-3.<br>
    2 Unicorns recruit 1 Ent in the Woods. An Ent is a 12-3. <br>
    2 Hydrae recruit 1 Chimera in the Desert. A Chimera is a 16-3.<br>
    2 Colossi recruit 1 Mammoth in the Tundra. A Mammoth is a 20-3.<br>
    <br>
    3 Rangers recruit 1 Air Elemental in the Marsh. An Air Elemental  is
a  5-4 flying magic-missiler.<br>
    3 Unicorns recruit 1 Earth Elemental in the Woods. An Earth Elemental 
 is a 8-4 flying magic-missiler. <br>
    3 Hydra recruit 1 Water Elemental in the Desert. A Water Elemental is 
 a 11-4 flying magic-missiler.<br>
    3 Colossi recruit 1 Fire Elemental in the Tundra. A Fire Elemental is 
 a 14-4 flying magic-missiler.    
<h2></h2>
      
<h2>
<h3>Undead? What's Undead?</h3>
</h2>
 Unified Titan also has Undead Creatures. Undead Creatures mirror Brush Creatures 
completely, except that they have 1 extra skill factor. Instead of being recruited
in the Brush, Jungle, Wasteland, they are recruited in the Graveyard, Tombs,
and Abyss which are drift based battleboards.<br>
 <br>
 Any Creature can recruit a Skeleton in a Castle, a 4-4 flying peice.<br>
2 Skeletons recruit a Zombie, 9-3, in the Graveyard.<br>
2 Zombies recruit a Lich, 6-4 flying rangestriker in the Graveyard.<br>
3 Liches recruit a Necromancer, 8-4 flying Rangestriker.<br>
<br>
2 Skeletons recruit a Zombie, 9-3, in the Tombs.<br>
3 Zombies recruit a Wraith, 8-4, in the Tombs.<br>
2 Wraiths recruit a Vampire, 18-3 in the Tombs.<br>
<br>
2 Zombies recruit a Wraith in the Abyss, 8-4 in the Abyss.<br>
3 Wraiths recruit a Reaper, 27-3, in the Abyss.<br>
<h2>What about the Masterboard, there seems to be a lot of new terrains?&nbsp;</h2>
    The Masterboard is almost identical to the original board, except new
half-circles containing keeps, castles, wastelands, tombs, and Abyss, are
all appended outside of the "bus".<br>
         
<h2>Who is responsible for Unified Titan?&nbsp;</h2>
    Abyssal6 Titan was originally created by David Newell. Eric Nielsen helped
  a great deal with balance-testing, and inspiration. Together the two of
them have tried to break Titan by changing the rules hundreds of times, rarely 
 succeeding. They would like to thank the original creators of Titan at Avalon 
 Hill for creating a superb game that has given them thousands of hours of 
 enjoyment. Also to be thanked are John Crowe, for introducing them to the 
 game, Nate Houle, for being a frequent play-partner and an extremely tough 
 opponent, the development team of Colossus for doing a wonderful adaptation
  of Titan and making many custom changes to the code that made Abyssal Titan
  possible, and Dave Wall, for during his first game of Titan, actually believing
  a player had to make the sound of the creature he was recruiting, forever 
  imortalizing the Ogre as an "Uunga-Bunga." <br>
