1) What is Badlands ?

Badlands is an extension to regular Titan, the game
from Avalon Hill upon which Colossus is based. It
is also a variant pack to allow Colossus player to
play (a close approximation of) Badlands.
See <http://www.cheewai.com/titan/variants_badlands.asp>,
for more details and the original copyright on Badlands.

Badlands was implemented in Colossus by Romain Dolbeau <dolbeau@irisa.fr>

2) How to use it ?

Just use the "Load Variant" button in Colossus, and
open the Badlands.var file inside the Badlands directory.
That should be enough. If not, please report the problem.

3) What are the differences with regular Titan ?

New Battlelands for some terrains.

4) What are the differences between the original Badlands
and Badlands in Colossus ?

In the original Badlands, Battlelands were used randomly
when multiple Battlelands were available. In the current
implementation for Colossus, alternate Battlelands are
distributed statically on the strategic map.

This restriction is due to technical limitations in Colossus,
it might be lifted in the future :-)
