README for Colossus Undead Variant

The Undead variant was contributed by OdysseasX Hal.

The overall feel is bigger and more varied creatures on a 
standard-sized board.

Brush and Jungle are replaced with Ruins and Tombs.  Many 
creatures are replaced with undead.  There are several large 
dragons atop the recruiting tree, which is otherwise similar 
to ExtTitan's.

Most terrain recruting trees are clearly visible within the
game.  The Tower tree is a bit confusing:

Creature        Recruiter
Paladin           Any
Skeleton          Any
Troglodyte        Any
Golem             3 of the same Creature, Golem
Harpy             4 of the same Creature, Harpy
Beholder          5 of the same Creature, Beholder
Wizard            Titan, Wizard

(Remember that Lords and Demi-Lords are not Creatures.)

Titans get bigger every 75 points.  Titan teleport comes at 
700 points.  

Many more characters can be Acquired, as follows:
