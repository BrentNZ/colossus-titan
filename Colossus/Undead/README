The Undead variant was contributed by OdysseasX Hal.

The overall feel is more and bigger creatures on a standard-sized board.

Brush and Jungle are replaced with Ruins and Tombs.  Many creatures
are replaced with undead.  There are several large dragons atop the
recruiting tree, which is otherwise similar to ExtTitan's.

Titans get bigger every 75 points.  Titan teleport comes at 700 points.
Archangels are earned every 300 points.  Elementals, Necromancers,
and The Reaper can be acquired instead of angels after winning engagements
in certain terrain types.
