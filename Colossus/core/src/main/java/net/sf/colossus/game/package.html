<p>
A package containing classes and interfaces modelling the a Colossus game.
</p>
<p>
Currently this package has not yet been fully established. It is meant to hold all code
relevant to model a game both in the static sense (board layouts, rules) as well as in the
dynamic sense (status of an ongoing game), possibly to be further separated later on.
</p>
<p>
This package is meant to be used both by server and client code, with no dependencies into
either of them.
